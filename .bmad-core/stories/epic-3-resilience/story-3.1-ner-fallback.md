# Story 3.1: Simple NER Fallback System

**Epic**: Resilience & Fallback  
**Story Points**: 4  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Review

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY**: Read `../LEAN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md` before implementation

## üìã User Story

**As a** system operator  
**I want** basic entity recognition when MCP services are unavailable  
**So that** processing continues with degraded but functional named entity recognition

## üéØ Business Value

- **Reliability**: System continues working when external services fail
- **Performance**: Local NER is faster than network calls  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces dependency on external API usage
- **Independence**: Core functionality works offline
- **Graceful Degradation**: Users get best available service quality

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

## üîß Technical Specifications

### **Entity Data Structure:**
```python
@dataclass
class EntityMatch:
    text: str           # Original text found
    entity: str         # Canonical entity name
    category: str       # deity, text, concept, place, person
    confidence: float   # 0.0 - 1.0
    start_pos: int      # Position in original text
    end_pos: int        # End position
    source: str         # 'simple_ner' vs 'mcp'
```

### **Core NER Algorithm:**
```python
def extract_entities(self, text: str) -> List[EntityMatch]:
    """
    Extract named entities using pattern matching.
    Fast, rule-based approach for common Sanskrit/Hindu entities.
    """
    entities = []
    text_lower = text.lower()
    
    for category, category_data in self.entities.items():
        base_confidence = category_data['confidence']
        
        for entity_info in category_data['entities']:
            canonical_name = entity_info['name']
            variations = [canonical_name.lower()] + entity_info.get('variations', [])
            
            for variation in variations:
                # Find all occurrences of this variation
                start = 0
                while True:
                    pos = text_lower.find(variation, start)
                    if pos == -1:
                        break
                    
                    # Check word boundaries to avoid partial matches
                    if self._is_word_boundary(text_lower, pos, pos + len(variation)):
                        # Calculate confidence based on variation quality
                        confidence = self._calculate_confidence(
                            variation, canonical_name, base_confidence
                        )
                        
                        entities.append(EntityMatch(
                            text=text[pos:pos+len(variation)],
                            entity=canonical_name,
                            category=category,
                            confidence=confidence,
                            start_pos=pos,
                            end_pos=pos + len(variation),
                            source='simple_ner'
                        ))
                    
                    start = pos + 1
    
    # Remove duplicates and overlaps
    return self._deduplicate_entities(entities)
```

### **Performance Optimizations:**
```python
def _build_lookup_tables(self):
    """Pre-compute lookup structures for fast matching."""
    self.lookup_trie = {}  # Trie structure for fast prefix matching
    self.category_map = {}  # Quick category lookup
    
    # Build optimized data structures for O(n) text scanning
```

### **Configuration Integration:**
```yaml
# config.yaml additions
ner:
  fallback:
    enabled: true
    entities_file: "data/entities.yaml"
    min_confidence: 0.7
    enable_fuzzy_matching: false
    log_fallback_usage: true
```

## üß™ Test Cases

### **Unit Tests:**
```python
def test_deity_detection():
    ner = SimpleNER("data/entities.yaml")
    entities = ner.extract_entities("Krishna and Shiva are important deities")
    
    assert len(entities) == 2
    assert entities[0].entity == "Krishna"
    assert entities[0].category == "deity"
    assert entities[0].confidence > 0.8

def test_scripture_recognition():
    ner = SimpleNER("data/entities.yaml")
    entities = ner.extract_entities("The Bhagavad Gita teaches us about dharma")
    
    scripture_entities = [e for e in entities if e.category == "scripture"]
    concept_entities = [e for e in entities if e.category == "concept"]
    
    assert len(scripture_entities) == 1
    assert len(concept_entities) == 1

def test_fallback_integration():
    processor = EnhancedSanskritProcessor()
    
    # Simulate MCP failure
    processor.mcp_client = None
    
    result = processor.process_text("Krishna teaches dharma in the Gita")
    
    # Should still work with simple NER
    assert "Krishna" in result[0]
    assert len(result[1]) > 0  # Some entities found

def test_performance_benchmark():
    ner = SimpleNER("data/entities.yaml")
    test_text = "Krishna and Arjuna discuss dharma in the Bhagavad Gita"
    
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(1000):
        entities = ner.extract_entities(test_text)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    assert duration < 1.0  # 1000 extractions in < 1 second
    assert len(entities) >= 4  # Should find Krishna, Arjuna, dharma, Bhagavad Gita
```

### **Integration Tests:**
```python
def test_mcp_fallback_switching():
    # Test automatic fallback when MCP fails
    # Test restoration when MCP becomes available
    # Test metrics tracking of fallback usage
    
def test_accuracy_comparison():
    # Compare simple NER results with known MCP results
    # Ensure > 80% accuracy for basic entities
    # Document precision/recall metrics
```

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Availability**: 100% uptime (never fails due to external dependencies)
- **Performance**: < 50ms entity extraction per segment
- **Accuracy**: > 80% precision for common entities vs manual annotation
- **Coverage**: Recognizes 50+ distinct entities across 5 categories
