## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: File Discovery & Validation (30 minutes)**
```python
class BatchProcessor:
    def discover_files(self, input_path: str, pattern: str = "*.srt") -> List[Path]:
        # Find all matching SRT files
        # Validate files are readable
        # Return sorted list for consistent processing
        
    def validate_batch(self, files: List[Path]) -> List[Path]:
        # Check file accessibility
        # Estimate processing time and memory needs  
        # Warn about potential issues
```

### **Phase 2: Progress Tracking System (45 minutes)**
```python
class ProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, total_files: int):
        self.total_files = total_files
        self.current_file = 0
        self.start_time = time.time()
        
    def update(self, file_name: str, segments_processed: int):
        # Update progress display
        # Calculate ETA and processing speed
        # Show memory usage if requested
        
    def display_progress(self):
        # Real-time progress bar
        # Current file and overall progress
        # Speed and ETA information
```

### **Phase 3: Batch Processing Engine (60 minutes)**  
```python
def process_batch(self, input_dir: Path, output_dir: Path, 
                 pattern: str = "*.srt") -> BatchResult:
    """Process multiple SRT files in batch."""
    files = self.discover_files(input_dir, pattern)
    results = []
    errors = []
    
    with ProgressTracker(len(files)) as progress:
        for file_path in files:
            try:
                result = self.process_single_file(file_path, output_dir)
                results.append(result)
                progress.update(file_path.name, result.segments_processed)
                
            except Exception as e:
                errors.append({"file": file_path, "error": str(e)})
                if self.stop_on_error:
                    break
                    
    return BatchResult(results, errors)
```

### **Phase 4: Reporting & CLI Integration (45 minutes)**
```python
class BatchReporter:
    def generate_summary(self, batch_result: BatchResult) -> str:
        # Consolidated metrics across all files
        # Success/failure breakdown  
        # Performance statistics
        
    def export_detailed_report(self, batch_result: BatchResult, format: str):
        # JSON or CSV export
        # Per-file metrics
        # Error details
```

### **Performance Optimizations:**

#### **Parallel Processing (Optional):**
```python
import multiprocessing as mp
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

def process_batch_parallel(self, files: List[Path], max_workers: int = 4):
    """Process files in parallel for improved performance."""
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        futures = {
            executor.submit(self.process_single_file, file_path): file_path 
            for file_path in files
        }
        
        results = []
        for future in as_completed(futures):
            try:
                result = future.result()
                results.append(result)
            except Exception as e:
                self.handle_error(futures[future], e)
                
    return results
```

#### **Memory Management:**
```python
def process_with_memory_management(self, files: List[Path]):
    """Process files with memory usage monitoring."""
    for i, file_path in enumerate(files):
        # Process file
        result = self.process_single_file(file_path)
        
        # Memory cleanup every N files  
        if i % 50 == 0:
            gc.collect()
            
        # Memory usage check
        if self.get_memory_usage() > self.max_memory_mb:
            self.logger.warning("High memory usage detected, forcing cleanup")
            gc.collect()
```

## 🧪 Test Cases

### **Unit Tests:**
```python
def test_file_discovery():
    batch_processor = BatchProcessor()
    
    # Create test directory with various files
    test_dir = create_test_directory_with_srt_files()
    
    files = batch_processor.discover_files(test_dir, "*.srt")
    assert len(files) == 5  # Expected number of SRT files
    assert all(f.suffix == '.srt' for f in files)

def test_progress_tracking():
    tracker = ProgressTracker(10)
    
    tracker.update("file1.srt", 100)
    assert tracker.current_file == 1
    assert tracker.get_percentage() == 10.0
    
    tracker.update("file5.srt", 200)  
    assert tracker.current_file == 2
    assert tracker.get_percentage() == 20.0

def test_error_isolation():
    batch_processor = BatchProcessor()
    
    # Mix of valid and invalid files
    files = [valid_file_1, invalid_file, valid_file_2]  
    
    result = batch_processor.process_batch(files)
    
    assert result.successful_files == 2
    assert result.failed_files == 1
    assert len(result.errors) == 1

def test_batch_reporting():
    batch_result = create_test_batch_result()  
    reporter = BatchReporter()
    
    summary = reporter.generate_summary(batch_result)
    assert "Total files processed: 10" in summary
    assert "Success rate: 90%" in summary
    
    # Test JSON export
    json_report = reporter.export_detailed_report(batch_result, "json")
    assert "files_processed" in json_report
```

### **Integration Tests:**
```python
def test_full_batch_workflow():
    # Create test directory with multiple SRT files
    test_input_dir = create_test_srt_directory(num_files=5)
    test_output_dir = create_temp_directory()
    
    # Run batch processing
    cli_result = run_cli_command([
        "enhanced_cli.py", "batch", 
        str(test_input_dir), str(test_output_dir),
        "--verbose"
    ])
    
    assert cli_result.returncode == 0
    
    # Verify all files were processed
    output_files = list(test_output_dir.glob("*.srt"))
    assert len(output_files) == 5
    
    # Verify processing results
    for output_file in output_files:
        assert output_file.stat().st_size > 0  # File has content

def test_incremental_processing():
    # Test that already processed files are skipped
    # Test resume functionality after interruption
    pass

def test_parallel_processing_performance():
    # Compare sequential vs parallel processing times
    # Verify results are identical
    pass
```

## 📊 Success Metrics
