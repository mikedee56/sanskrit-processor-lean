### **Performance Considerations:**
```python
# Lexicon loading optimization for larger datasets
class OptimizedLexiconLoader:
    def __init__(self, lexicon_dir: Path):
        self.lexicon_dir = Path(lexicon_dir) 
        self.corrections = {}
        self.proper_nouns = {}
        self._variation_index = {}  # Fast lookup for variations
        self._load_lexicons()
        self._build_indexes()
    
    def _build_indexes(self):
        """Build fast lookup indexes for variations."""
        for term, data in self.corrections.items():
            for variation in data.get('variations', []):
                self._variation_index[variation.lower()] = term
```

## üß™ Test Cases

### **Unit Tests:**
```python
def test_expanded_lexicon_loading():
    lexicons = LexiconLoader("lexicons")
    
    # Test new philosophical terms
    assert "advaita" in lexicons.corrections
    assert "pranayama" in lexicons.corrections
    assert "puja" in lexicons.corrections
    
    # Test new proper nouns
    assert "ganesha" in lexicons.proper_nouns
    assert "vyasa" in lexicons.proper_nouns
    assert "vrindavan" in lexicons.proper_nouns

def test_variation_recognition():
    processor = SanskritProcessor()
    
    # Test philosophical term variations
    result, corrections = processor.process_text("I study adwita vedanta")
    assert "advaita" in result
    assert corrections >= 1
    
    # Test proper noun variations
    result, corrections = processor.process_text("ganesh is beloved")
    assert "Ganesha" in result
    assert corrections >= 1

def test_transliteration_accuracy():
    lexicons = LexiconLoader("lexicons")
    
    # Verify IAST transliterations are properly formatted
    advaita = lexicons.corrections["advaita"]  
    assert "ƒÅ" in advaita["transliteration"]  # Proper IAST long 'a'
    
    pranayama = lexicons.corrections["pranayama"]
    assert "·πá" in pranayama["transliteration"]  # Proper IAST retroflex 'n'

def test_no_duplicates():
    lexicons = LexiconLoader("lexicons")
    
    # Check for duplicate entries across files
    correction_terms = set(lexicons.corrections.keys())
    proper_noun_terms = set(lexicons.proper_nouns.keys())
    
    # Should be no overlap between corrections and proper nouns
    overlap = correction_terms & proper_noun_terms
    assert len(overlap) == 0, f"Duplicate terms found: {overlap}"

def test_performance_with_extended_lexicon():
    processor = SanskritProcessor()
    test_text = "Krishna teaches advaita to arjuna in vrindavan during pranayama"
    
    start_time = time.time()
    result, corrections = processor.process_text(test_text)
    duration = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Should still be fast with expanded lexicon
    assert duration < 0.01  # < 10ms
    assert corrections >= 4  # Should find multiple terms
```

### **Integration Tests:**
```python
def test_real_lecture_processing():
    # Test with realistic spiritual lecture content
    lecture_text = """
    Today we will discuss the principles of advaita vedanta
    as taught by adi shankara. Through pranayama and dhyana,
    we can understand our true nature. ganesh removes obstacles
    on our spiritual path to vrindavan consciousness.
    """
    
    processor = SanskritProcessor()  
    result, corrections = processor.process_text(lecture_text)
    
    # Verify proper processing of extended vocabulary
    assert "advaita" in result
    assert "Adi Shankara" in result  
    assert "Ganesha" in result
    assert "Vrindavan" in result
    assert corrections >= 6
```
