## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Documentation becomes stale | Medium | Link to code where possible, not duplicate |
| Too much detail slows maintenance | Low | Focus on architecture, not implementation details |
| Inconsistent ADR usage | Low | Provide clear template and examples |

## ü§ñ Dev Agent Preparation

**When implementing this story:**

1. **Read Existing State**: Examine current codebase structure thoroughly
2. **Document Reality**: Focus on actual implementation, not ideal architecture
3. **Identify Patterns**: Highlight lean architecture patterns achieved
4. **Enable Future**: Document extension points for upcoming stories
5. **Stay Lean**: Keep documentation focused and maintainable

**Key Files to Analyze:**
- `cli.py` (251 lines) - Unified CLI interface
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py` (752 lines) - Core processing engine
- `enhanced_processor.py` (238 lines) - External service integration
- `services/external.py` (117 lines) - Consolidated service layer
- `config.yaml` - Configuration patterns
- `requirements.txt` - Dependency management

**Success Criteria**: Documentation that enables any developer to understand and extend the current lean architecture without breaking its principles.

**Story Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Implementation
