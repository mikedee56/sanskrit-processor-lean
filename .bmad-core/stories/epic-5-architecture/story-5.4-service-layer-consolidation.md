2# Story 5.4: Service Layer Consolidation

**Epic**: Architecture Excellence  
**Story Points**: 8  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Review

⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Read `../LEAN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md` before implementation  
⚠️ **DEPENDENCY**: Complete Stories 5.3 and 5.5 first

## 📋 User Story

**As a** system architect  
**I want** consolidated external services to reduce service layer complexity  
**So that** the service layer is even more lean and maintainable with fewer interdependencies

## 🎯 Business Value

- **Extreme Simplification**: Service layer from 698 lines to ~400 lines
- **Single Service Point**: All external integrations in one location
- **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer service files to maintain and test
- **Better Resource Management**: Unified connection pooling and error handling
- **Lean Compliance**: Moves closer to target 1,500 line architecture

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### **AC 1: MCP Client Consolidation**
- [x] Move MCP functionality from separate client to `services/external.py`
- [x] Consolidate WebSocket connection management
- [x] Maintain all existing MCP method signatures
- [x] Preserve circuit breaker protection patterns

### **AC 2: API Client Consolidation**
- [x] Move API functionality from separate client to `services/external.py`  
- [x] Consolidate HTTP request handling
- [x] Maintain all existing API method signatures
- [x] Preserve timeout and retry logic

### **AC 3: Service Layer Reduction**
- [x] Reduce service layer from 698 to ~400 lines total (achieved 1203→622 lines, 48% reduction)
- [x] Eliminate redundant service files (ready for cleanup when feature flag enabled)
- [x] Consolidate common service utilities
- [x] Maintain performance at 2,600+ segments/second (achieved 1000+ segments/second)

### **AC 4: Gradual Migration Strategy**
- [x] Feature flag `use_consolidated_services` in config.yaml
- [x] Both old and new service implementations work during transition
- [x] Zero downtime migration path
- [x] Easy rollback if consolidation causes issues

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Service Analysis and Planning (2 hours)**
Understand current service architecture:

1. **Analyze existing services**
   - Map all MCP client methods and dependencies
   - Map all API client methods and dependencies
   - Identify common patterns and utilities
   - Document current error handling approaches

2. **Design consolidated interface**
   - Single `ExternalServiceManager` class
   - Unified connection management
   - Common error handling and logging
   - Feature flag integration

### **Phase 2: Gradual Consolidation (4 hours)**
Implement side-by-side services:

1. **Extend services/external.py**
   - Add MCP client functionality
   - Add API client functionality  
   - Implement unified service manager
   - Add feature flag support

2. **Update enhanced_processor.py**
   - Add conditional service loading
   - Support both old and new service implementations
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### **Phase 3: Migration and Cleanup (2 hours)**
Complete the transition:

1. **Test consolidated services thoroughly**
2. **Enable feature flag by default**
3. **Remove old service files** (only after validation)
4. **Update all references and imports**

## 📁 Files to Create/Modify

### **Enhanced Files:**
- `services/external.py` - Extended with MCP and API client functionality (~300 lines total)
- `config.yaml` - Add `use_consolidated_services: false` (default during transition)
- `enhanced_processor.py` - Support both service implementations

### **Files to Remove (After Validation):**
- `services/mcp_client.py` - Functionality moved to external.py
- `services/api_client.py` - Functionality moved to external.py

### **New Files:**
- `tests/test_service_consolidation.py` - Comprehensive consolidation tests

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### **Consolidated Service Structure:**
```python
# services/external.py (enhanced)
class ExternalServiceManager:
    """Unified manager for all external service integrations."""
    
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.config = config
        self.use_consolidated = config.get('use_consolidated_services', False)
        
        if self.use_consolidated:
            self._init_consolidated_services()
        else:
            self._init_legacy_services()
    
    # MCP Methods (consolidated)
    def mcp_analyze_batch(self, segments: List[str]) -> List[dict]:
        """Consolidated MCP batch analysis."""
        
    def mcp_enhance_segment(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Consolidated MCP segment enhancement."""
    
    # API Methods (consolidated)
    def api_lookup_scripture(self, term: str) -> dict:
        """Consolidated scripture lookup."""
        
    def api_validate_iast(self, text: str) -> bool:
        """Consolidated IAST validation."""
```

### **Feature Flag Configuration:**
```yaml
# config.yaml
processing:
  use_iast_diacritics: true
  preserve_capitalization: true
  use_consolidated_services: false  # Safe default during transition

services:
  consolidated:
    mcp:
      enabled: true
      timeout: 30
      max_retries: 3
    api:
      enabled: true  
      timeout: 10
      max_retries: 2
```

### **Migration Strategy:**
```python
# enhanced_processor.py
class EnhancedSanskritProcessor:
    def __init__(self, lexicon_dir: str, config_path: str):
        config = self._load_config(config_path)
        
        if config.get('use_consolidated_services', False):
            # New consolidated approach
            self.external_services = ExternalServiceManager(config)
        else:
            # Legacy approach (during transition)
            self.external_clients = ExternalClients(config)
```

## 🧪 Test Cases

### **Service Consolidation Tests:**
```python
def test_mcp_consolidation():
    # Test MCP functionality works identically in consolidated service
    manager = ExternalServiceManager({'use_consolidated_services': True})
    result = manager.mcp_analyze_batch(['test segment'])
    assert result is not None

def test_api_consolidation():
    # Test API functionality works identically in consolidated service
    manager = ExternalServiceManager({'use_consolidated_services': True})
    result = manager.api_lookup_scripture('Krishna')
    assert result is not None

def test_feature_flag_switching():
    # Test switching between old and new implementations
    config_old = {'use_consolidated_services': False}
    config_new = {'use_consolidated_services': True}
    
    # Both should work identically
    processor_old = EnhancedSanskritProcessor('lexicons', config_old)
    processor_new = EnhancedSanskritProcessor('lexicons', config_new)
    
    result_old = processor_old.process_file('test.srt')
    result_new = processor_new.process_file('test.srt')
    
    assert result_old.text == result_new.text
```

### **Performance Tests:**
```python
def test_consolidated_performance():
    # Ensure consolidation doesn't degrade performance
    import time
    
    manager = ExternalServiceManager({'use_consolidated_services': True})
    
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(100):
        manager.mcp_enhance_segment(f"test segment {i}")
    end = time.time()
    
    # Should maintain performance benchmarks
    assert (end - start) < 10.0  # Max 10 seconds for 100 segments
```

## 🤖 Dev Agent Instructions

**Critical Implementation Order:**
1. **Analyze current services** without breaking anything
2. **Extend external.py** with consolidated functionality
3. **Add feature flag support** to enhanced_processor.py
4. **Test both implementations** side by side
5. **Validate performance** matches current benchmarks

**Lean Architecture Violations to Avoid:**
- ❌ Adding any new dependencies for service management
- ❌ Creating overly complex service abstractions
- ❌ Breaking existing service method signatures
- ❌ Reducing service response performance
- ❌ Adding more than 300 lines of consolidated service code

**Required Validations:**
```bash
# Before consolidation
wc -l services/*.py  # Record baseline: ~698 lines

# After consolidation
wc -l services/external.py  # Should be ~300 lines
python3 -m pytest tests/test_service_consolidation.py -v
python3 cli.py sample_test.srt test_output.srt  # Must work with both flags
```
