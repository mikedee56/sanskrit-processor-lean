**Epic**: Performance & Reliability  
**Story Points**: 3  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for Review

‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY**: Read `../LEAN_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md` before implementation

## üìã User Story

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Core Algorithm (45 minutes)**
```python
def calculate_similarity(str1: str, str2: str) -> float:
    """
    Calculate character-based similarity ratio.
    Uses simple character matching without external dependencies.
    """
    # Normalize strings (lowercase, strip)
    # Handle length differences  
    # Count matching characters in positions
    # Return ratio 0.0 - 1.0
```

### **Phase 2: Lexicon Integration (30 minutes)**
```python
def _apply_fuzzy_corrections(self, text: str) -> tuple[str, int]:
    """Apply fuzzy matching to uncorrected words."""
    # Split into words
    # For each word not in exact lexicon:
    #   Try fuzzy match against all terms
    #   Apply best match if above threshold
```

### **Phase 3: Configuration (15 minutes)**
```yaml
# Add to config.yaml
processing:
  fuzzy_matching:
    enabled: true
    threshold: 0.8
    log_matches: false
```

### **Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (30 minutes)**
```python
# Unit tests for similarity algorithm
# Performance benchmarking  
# Integration testing with real SRT content
```

## üìÅ Files to Create/Modify

### **Modified Files:**
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py` - Add similarity method and integration
- `config.yaml` - Add fuzzy matching configuration
- `README.md` - Document fuzzy matching feature

### **New Files:**
- `tests/test_fuzzy_matching.py` - Unit tests

## üîß Technical Specifications

### **Algorithm Choice: Character Position Matching**
```python
def calculate_similarity(str1: str, str2: str) -> float:
    """
    Simple character similarity without external dependencies.
    Based on character position matching with length normalization.
    """
    if not str1 or not str2:
        return 0.0
    
    # Quick length check - very different lengths = low similarity
    len_diff = abs(len(str1) - len(str2))
    max_len = max(len(str1), len(str2))
    if len_diff / max_len > 0.5:  # More than 50% length difference
        return 0.0
    
    # Normalize
    s1, s2 = str1.lower().strip(), str2.lower().strip()
    
    # Count matching characters at same positions
    matches = sum(1 for i, (a, b) in enumerate(zip(s1, s2)) if a == b)
    
    # Add partial credit for similar length
    length_similarity = 1.0 - (len_diff / max_len)
    
    # Combine position matches with length similarity  
    position_similarity = matches / max_len
    
    return (position_similarity * 0.7) + (length_similarity * 0.3)
```

### **Integration Pattern:**
```python
def _apply_lexicon_corrections(self, text: str) -> tuple[str, int]:
    """Enhanced with fuzzy matching fallback."""
    corrections = 0
    words = text.split()
    corrected_words = []
    
    for word in words:
        clean_word = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', word.lower())
        
        # Try exact match first (existing logic)
        if clean_word in self.lexicons.corrections:
            # ... existing exact match logic
        
        # Try fuzzy match if enabled and no exact match
        elif self.config.get('processing', {}).get('fuzzy_matching', {}).get('enabled', False):
            best_match = self._find_fuzzy_match(clean_word)
            if best_match:
                corrected_words.append(best_match)
                corrections += 1
                logger.debug(f"Fuzzy correction: {word} -> {best_match}")
            else:
                corrected_words.append(word)
        else:
            corrected_words.append(word)
    
    return ' '.join(corrected_words), corrections
```

## üß™ Test Cases

### **Unit Tests:**

## üìù Implementation Notes

### **Why Not Use fuzzywuzzy/Levenshtein?**
- Adds external dependency (against lean architecture)
- Overkill for our simple use case
- Our character-position algorithm is sufficient for ASR variations
- Easier to understand and modify

### **Algorithm Trade-offs:**
- **Chosen**: Character position matching
  - ‚úÖ Simple, fast, no dependencies
  - ‚úÖ Good for ASR-style errors (missing/extra chars)
  - ‚ùå Less sophisticated than edit distance

- **Rejected**: Levenshtein distance  
  - ‚úÖ More accurate for complex variations
  - ‚ùå Requires external library or complex implementation
  - ‚ùå Slower performance

### **Threshold Tuning:**
- Start with 0.8 (80% similarity)
- Monitor false positives/negatives
- May need term-specific thresholds

---

**Dependencies**: None (Story 1.1 can run in parallel)  
**Estimated completion**: Day 2 of sprint

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-04

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation quality. The fuzzy matching system demonstrates sophisticated multi-factor similarity calculation using position matching, character set intersection, length similarity, and sequential matching. The 4-factor weighted approach (0.3 + 0.25 + 0.2 + 0.25) is well-optimized for ASR-style transcription errors. Code is clean, well-documented, and follows established patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The implementation already demonstrates excellent code quality, appropriate separation of concerns, and optimal performance characteristics.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ‚úì Follows Python conventions, proper docstrings, clear variable naming
- Project Structure: ‚úì Maintains lean architecture, no new dependencies, integrates cleanly
- Testing Strategy: ‚úì Comprehensive test suite with 8 test cases covering all acceptance criteria
