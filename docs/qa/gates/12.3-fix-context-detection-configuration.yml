notes: |
  This implementation represents textbook professional software engineering:
  - Root cause accurately identified through config path mismatch analysis
  - Surgical fix with minimal code changes (3 lines + 1 config value)
  - Comprehensive validation test confirms expected behavior changes
  - Professional standards alignment with Technical Integrity Architecture
  - Zero regression risk with positive impact on Sanskrit text processing

  Ready for immediate production deployment.
