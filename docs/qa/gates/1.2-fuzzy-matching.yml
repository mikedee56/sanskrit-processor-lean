# Implementation highlights
implementation_notes: |
  Outstanding implementation featuring:
  - Multi-factor similarity algorithm (position + character set + length + sequential)
  - Optimal performance with early termination and length short-circuiting
  - Comprehensive test suite with 100% AC coverage
  - Zero-dependency approach maintaining lean architecture
  - Configuration flexibility with graceful fallback
