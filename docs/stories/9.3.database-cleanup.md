## Dev Notes

### Database Analysis Context
**Current Database Statistics:**
- **Total entries**: 9,056 
- **Unique terms**: 1,934
- **Issue**: Many entries appear to be synthetic/generated with English contamination

**Known Contamination Examples:**
- English words with Sanskrit diacriticals: "treāding", "agītāted"
- Pure English words stored as Sanskrit terms
- Generated terms that don't exist in actual Sanskrit literature

### Root Cause Analysis
**How contamination occurred:**
1. **Auto-generation**: Script created Sanskrit-ized versions of English words
2. **ASR corruption**: Speech recognition errors created hybrid English-Sanskrit terms  
3. **Import validation missing**: No validation when importing external term lists
4. **Synthetic data**: Algorithmically generated terms without linguistic validation

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Protection (Stories 9.1 & 9.2 MUST be completed first)
- Implement context detection and scripture API fixes
- Ensure system is protected before data cleanup
- Validate protection mechanisms work

#### Phase 2: Analysis & Backup
- Comprehensive contamination analysis
- Create multiple backup copies
- Document cleanup strategy

#### Phase 3: Surgical Cleanup  
- Remove obvious English contamination
- Preserve all valid Sanskrit terms
- Validate each step

#### Phase 4: Validation & Prevention
- Add import validation rules
- Create ongoing monitoring
- Prevent future contamination

### Database Schema Context
**Tables involved:**
- `terms` table: main Sanskrit terms storage
- Columns: `id`, `original_term`, `transliteration`, `variations`, `category`, `confidence`

**Cleanup SQL Examples:**
```sql
-- Find ASCII-only entries (potential English)
SELECT id, original_term, transliteration 
FROM terms 
WHERE original_term NOT GLOB '*[āīūṛṝḷḹṁṃḥśṣṇṭḍñ]*' 
AND transliteration NOT GLOB '*[āīūṛṝḷḹṁṃḥśṣṇṭḍñ]*';

-- Remove entries matching English dictionary words
DELETE FROM terms 
WHERE LOWER(original_term) IN ('treading', 'agitated', 'reading', 'leading', ...);
```

### File Locations
- **Database**: `/data/sanskrit_terms.db` (main database)
- **Backup directory**: `/data/backups/` (create if needed)
- **Backup files**: `/data/backups/sanskrit_terms_backup_[timestamp].db`
- **Audit log**: `/data/cleanup_audit.log` (removal tracking)
- **Validation module**: `/utils/database_validator.py` (new file)
- **Cleanup script**: `/scripts/database_cleanup.py` (new file)
- **Tests**: `/tests/test_database_validation.py` (comprehensive tests)

### Validation Rules Implementation

#### Entry Validation Function
```python
def validate_sanskrit_entry(entry):
    """Validate a Sanskrit database entry."""
    original = entry.get('original_term', '')
    transliteration = entry.get('transliteration', '')
    
    # Must have Sanskrit diacriticals OR be on whitelist
    sanskrit_chars = set('āīūṛṝḷḹṁṃḥśṣṇṭḍñ')
    has_sanskrit = any(char in original + transliteration for char in sanskrit_chars)
    
    # Check against English word list
    if original.lower() in ENGLISH_WORD_LIST:
        return False, "English word detected"
    
    # Require Sanskrit markers unless whitelisted
    if not has_sanskrit and original not in SANSKRIT_WHITELIST:
        return False, "No Sanskrit diacriticals found"
    
    return True, "Valid Sanskrit entry"
```

### Testing Standards
- **Framework**: pytest with database fixtures
- **Database**: Use test database copy for validation
- **Coverage**: Test all validation rules and edge cases
- **Performance**: Ensure cleanup doesn't impact system performance
- **Rollback**: Test ability to restore from backup if needed

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Data Safety**: Never remove valid Sanskrit terms
2. **Complete cleanup**: Remove all English contamination  
3. **Future prevention**: Validation rules prevent recontamination
4. **Auditability**: Complete record of what was changed and why
5. **Performance**: Database performance maintained or improved

### Dependencies
- **Stories 9.1 & 9.2**: MUST be completed first for protection
- **Database access**: Read/write permissions to sanskrit_terms.db
- **Backup storage**: Space for database backups (~50MB estimated)
- **English dictionary**: Comprehensive English word list for validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Multiple backups**: Create several backup copies before cleanup
- **Staged rollout**: Clean in phases with validation between each
- **Rollback plan**: Documented procedure to restore from backup
- **Validation**: Extensive testing of cleaned database before deployment

## Testing

### Test File Location
`/tests/test_database_validation.py`

### Test Framework  
- **pytest** for test execution
- **sqlite3** for database operations
- **temporary databases** for isolated testing

### Testing Standards
- Use test database copies (never modify production)
- Test each validation rule individually
- Verify backup and restore procedures
- Performance tests for large-scale operations

### Specific Test Requirements

1. **Backup and Restore Tests**
   - Create backup → verify integrity → restore → validate completeness
   - Test backup with corrupted source database
   - Verify backup metadata accuracy

2. **Contamination Detection Tests**
   - Detect known English words in database
   - Find entries lacking Sanskrit diacriticals  
   - Validate contamination analysis accuracy

3. **Cleanup Operation Tests**
   - Remove English entries → verify only English removed
   - Clean variations → preserve valid Sanskrit variations
   - Database optimization → maintain functionality

4. **Validation Rule Tests**
   - Valid Sanskrit entries → accepted
   - English word entries → rejected with proper reason
   - Edge cases (mixed, technical terms) → handled correctly

5. **Integration Tests**
   - Cleaned database → Sanskrit processing still works
   - Import validation → prevents future contamination
   - Performance → no significant degradation
