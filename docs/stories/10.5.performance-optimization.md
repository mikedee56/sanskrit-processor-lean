## Dev Notes

### Performance Baseline Analysis
**Current Performance** (from test file analysis):
- **Enhanced Mode**: 510 segments in 0.5s = 947 segments/second
- **Simple Mode**: 510 segments in 37.0s = 14 segments/second

**ASR Mode Target**: 500 segments in <2 seconds = 250+ segments/second

**Performance Gap Analysis**:
- Simple mode is 67x slower than enhanced mode
- Adding fuzzy matching, ASR patterns will likely slow processing further
- Need aggressive optimization to maintain usable performance

### Critical Performance Bottlenecks

#### 1. Systematic Matcher Performance
```python
# Current: O(n) linear search through 1,050 terms per segment
# Solution: Optimized indexing and caching

class PerformanceOptimizedMatcher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.exact_match_cache = {}     # O(1) exact matches
        self.fuzzy_match_cache = {}     # Cache expensive fuzzy calculations
        self.pattern_cache = {}         # Pre-compiled regex patterns
        
    @lru_cache(maxsize=2000)
    def get_correction(self, term: str) -> Optional[str]:
        # Cached lookup with LRU eviction
        pass
```

#### 2. Context Detection Optimization
```python
# Current: Full context analysis for every segment
# Solution: Smart caching and early termination

class OptimizedContextDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context_cache = {}
        self.sanskrit_markers = set(self.load_sanskrit_markers())  # O(1) lookup
        
    def detect_context_fast(self, text: str) -> ContextResult:
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = hash(text)
        if cache_key in self.context_cache:
            return self.context_cache[cache_key]
            
        # Fast path for obvious cases
        if any(marker in text for marker in self.high_confidence_sanskrit_markers):
            result = ContextResult(context_type='sanskrit', confidence=0.95)
        # ... more optimization
        
        self.context_cache[cache_key] = result
        return result
```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Performance Cache System
```python
from functools import lru_cache
import time
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional

class PerformanceCache:
    def __init__(self, max_size: int = 2000, ttl: int = 3600):
        self.max_size = max_size
        self.ttl = ttl
        self.cache: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]] = {}
        self.stats = {
            'hits': 0,
            'misses': 0,
            'evictions': 0
        }
        
    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:
        if key in self.cache:
            entry = self.cache[key]
            if time.time() - entry['timestamp'] < self.ttl:
                self.stats['hits'] += 1
                return entry['value']
            else:
                del self.cache[key]  # Expired
                
        self.stats['misses'] += 1
        return None
        
    def put(self, key: str, value: Any):
        if len(self.cache) >= self.max_size:
            # Evict oldest entry
            oldest_key = min(self.cache.keys(), 
                           key=lambda k: self.cache[k]['timestamp'])
            del self.cache[oldest_key]
            self.stats['evictions'] += 1
            
        self.cache[key] = {
            'value': value,
            'timestamp': time.time()
        }
        
    def hit_rate(self) -> float:
        total = self.stats['hits'] + self.stats['misses']
        return self.stats['hits'] / total if total > 0 else 0.0
```

#### Batch Processing Implementation
```python
class BatchProcessor:
    def __init__(self, processor, max_workers: int = None):
        self.processor = processor
        self.max_workers = max_workers or os.cpu_count()
        
    def process_directory(self, input_dir: Path, output_dir: Path, 
                         pattern: str = "*.srt") -> BatchResult:
        files = list(input_dir.glob(pattern))
        results = []
        
        with tqdm(total=len(files), desc="Processing files") as pbar:
            if self.max_workers > 1:
                # Parallel processing
                with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_workers) as executor:
                    future_to_file = {
                        executor.submit(self.process_file, file, output_dir): file
                        for file in files
                    }
                    
                    for future in as_completed(future_to_file):
                        file = future_to_file[future]
                        result = future.result()
                        results.append(result)
                        pbar.update(1)
            else:
                # Sequential processing with progress
                for file in files:
                    result = self.process_file(file, output_dir)
                    results.append(result)
                    pbar.update(1)
                    
        return BatchResult(results)
```

#### Memory-Efficient Processing
```python
class MemoryOptimizedProcessor:
    def __init__(self, chunk_size: int = 100):
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size
        self.memory_monitor = MemoryMonitor()
        
    def process_large_file(self, file_path: Path) -> ProcessingResult:
        segments = self.parse_file(file_path)
        processed_segments = []
        
        # Process in chunks to control memory usage
        for i in range(0, len(segments), self.chunk_size):
            chunk = segments[i:i + self.chunk_size]
            processed_chunk = self.process_chunk(chunk)
            processed_segments.extend(processed_chunk)
            
            # Memory check and cleanup
            if self.memory_monitor.usage() > 0.8:  # 80% threshold
                gc.collect()
                
        return ProcessingResult(processed_segments)
```
