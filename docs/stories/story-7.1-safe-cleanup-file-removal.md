# Story 7.1: Safe Cleanup & File Removal - Brownfield Cleanup

## User Story

As a **Sanskrit Processor maintainer**,
I want to **remove all development artifacts, debug scripts, and test files that are not used in production**,
So that **the codebase is cleaner, easier to navigate, and has reduced maintenance overhead**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: Git repository structure, import statements, file system organization
- Technology: Python file system, YAML test data, development scripts
- Follows pattern: Maintain production code structure while removing development artifacts
- Touch points: File imports, lexicon loading paths, debug script references

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Remove 23 debug scripts** (`debug_*.py` files) that are not referenced in production code
2. **Remove 6 test lexicon files** (`test_corrections_*.yaml`) that are only used for development testing
3. **Remove backup processor files** (`.backup`, `_original.py` files) that are legacy artifacts
4. **Clean git history references** to ensure removed files don't break any documentation

**Integration Requirements:**

5. Existing **lexicon loading functionality** continues to work unchanged with production lexicon files
6. New file structure follows existing **modular organization pattern** with cleaner separation
7. Integration with **configuration system** maintains current behavior for production settings

**Quality Requirements:**

8. **All production functionality verified** through sample SRT file processing
9. **Documentation updated** to reflect cleaned file structure
10. **No regression in processing capabilities** verified through existing test suite

## Technical Notes

**Integration Approach:**
- Identify and preserve all files referenced in actual production imports
- Remove only files that are clearly development/testing artifacts
- Maintain current directory structure but with cleaned contents

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- Follow current lexicon loading pattern in `LexiconLoader` class
- Maintain existing import patterns in production modules
- Preserve all active configuration file references

**Key Constraints:**
- Must not break any production imports or references
- Must preserve all files referenced by `cli.py`, `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`, or `enhanced_processor.py`
- Must maintain backward compatibility for configuration loading

## Detailed Removal Plan

### Files to Remove (Safe - No Production References):

**Debug Scripts (23 files):**
```
debug_compound.py
debug_compound_fixed.py
debug_compound_real.py
debug_condition.py
debug_context_detection.py
debug_english_fix.py
debug_find_corrections.py
debug_imports.py
debug_legacy_steps.py
debug_lexicon_loading.py
debug_pattern_matching.py
debug_processing.py
debug_processing_detailed.py
debug_quality_gate.py
debug_scripture_matches.py
debug_srt_parsing.py
debug_standalone.py
debug_standalone_corrections.py
debug_systematic.py
debug_t_detailed.py
debug_t_issue.py
debug_utpatti.py
debug_word_by_word.py
```

**Test Lexicon Files (6 files):**
```
lexicons/test_corrections_100.yaml
lexicons/test_corrections_500.yaml
lexicons/test_corrections_1000.yaml
lexicons/test_corrections_2000.yaml
lexicons/test_corrections_5000.yaml
lexicons/test_corrections_10000.yaml
```

**Backup Files (2 files):**
```
processors/systematic_term_matcher.py.backup
processors/systematic_term_matcher_original.py
```

### Verification Steps:

1. **Grep Analysis:** Verify no imports or references to these files in production code
2. **Sample Processing:** Test sample SRT files before and after removal
3. **Configuration Loading:** Verify config.yaml continues to load correctly
4. **Import Verification:** Ensure all production imports continue working

## Definition of Done

- [x] All 31 identified files removed from repository
- [x] Git history cleaned (files added to .gitignore if needed)
- [x] Sample SRT file processing produces identical results before/after cleanup
- [x] All production imports continue working without errors
- [x] Configuration system loads successfully
- [x] No broken references in documentation or code comments
- [x] Repository size reduced and navigation improved
- [ ] README.md updated to reflect cleaner structure

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** Accidentally removing a file that has hidden production usage
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive grep search for all filenames and careful analysis of imports
- **Rollback:** Git-based rollback of the entire removal commit if any issues detected

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [x] No breaking changes to existing CLI commands
- [x] Lexicon loading paths remain functional for production files
- [x] No impact on external service integrations
- [x] File structure changes don't break deployment scripts

## Testing Strategy

**Pre-Removal Verification:**
```bash
# Verify no production references to debug files
grep -r "debug_" --include="*.py" sanskrit_processor_v2.py enhanced_processor.py cli.py

# Verify no references to test lexicons in production
grep -r "test_corrections" --include="*.py" sanskrit_processor_v2.py enhanced_processor.py cli.py

# Verify no references to backup files
grep -r "\.backup\|_original" --include="*.py" .
```

**Post-Removal Verification:**
```bash
# Test basic functionality
python cli.py sample_test.srt test_output.srt --simple --verbose

# Test enhanced functionality
python cli.py sample_test.srt test_output.srt --config config.yaml --verbose

# Test configuration validation
python cli.py --validate-config
```

## Expected Impact

**Quantitative Benefits:**
- **Files Removed:** 31 files (~15% of total files)
- **Code Reduction:** ~2,000 lines of debug/test code
- **Repository Size:** Reduced by development artifacts
- **Navigation:** Cleaner directory listings

**Qualitative Benefits:**
- **Developer Experience:** Easier to identify production vs development code
- **Onboarding:** New developers see only relevant production files
- **Maintenance:** Reduced surface area for dependency updates
- **Clarity:** Clear separation between active and historical code

This story provides immediate cleanup benefits with minimal risk, setting the foundation for the more complex cleanup phases to follow.
