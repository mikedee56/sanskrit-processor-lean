# Story 7.1: Quality Enhancement - Line Break & Text Preservation

## Story
**As a** Sanskrit transcription editor  
**I want** the processor to preserve line breaks and multi-line formatting in SRT segments  
**So that** the original structure and readability of subtitles is maintained

## Background
Current implementation destroys multi-line text by replacing ALL whitespace (including newlines) with single spaces. This causes issues like:
- "Universe; Destroyer..." becoming "Jagat Destroyer..."
- Multi-line segments collapsing into single lines
- Loss of visual structure in subtitles

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GIVEN** an SRT file with multi-line segments  
   **WHEN** processing the file  
   **THEN** line breaks within segments must be preserved

2. **GIVEN** text with mixed whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)  
   **WHEN** normalizing whitespace  
   **THEN** only consecutive spaces/tabs are collapsed, newlines remain

3. **GIVEN** a segment with Sanskrit corrections  
   **WHEN** applying lexicon corrections  
   **THEN** the line structure is maintained after corrections

## Technical Details
### Root Cause
- Line 423: `re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)` replaces ALL whitespace
- Line 501: `text.split()` splits on ALL whitespace including newlines
- Line 595: `' '.join()` rejoins with single spaces only

### Solution Approach
1. Modify whitespace normalization to preserve newlines:
   ```python
   # FROM: text = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', text)
   # TO:   text = re.sub(r'[ \\t]+', ' ', text)  # Only collapse spaces/tabs
   ```

2. Process text line-by-line in lexicon corrections:
   ```python
   lines = text.split('\\n')
   processed_lines = []
   for line in lines:
       words = line.split()
       # ... process words ...
       processed_lines.append(' '.join(corrected_words))
   return '\\n'.join(processed_lines)
   ```

## Definition of Done
- [x] Line breaks are preserved in all processing stages
- [x] Unit tests verify multi-line preservation
- [x] Integration tests confirm SRT structure maintained
- [x] No regression in single-line processing
- [x] Performance impact < 5%

## Test Cases
1. **Multi-line preservation**:
   ```
   Input:  "Om namah shivaya\\nOm namah shivaya"
   Output: "Om namah shivaya\\nOm namah shivaya"
   ```

2. **Mixed whitespace normalization**:
   ```
   Input:  "Word1  \\t  Word2\\nLine2"
   Output: "Word1 Word2\\nLine2"
   ```

## QA Notes
- Test with real SRT files containing multi-line verses
- Verify subtitle display in video players
- Check for edge cases with empty lines
- Validate Windows (\\r\\n) vs Unix (\\n) line endings

# Story 7.2: Smart Translation Control

## Story
**As a** content reviewer  
**I want** the processor to avoid over-translating common English words  
**So that** the text remains natural and contextually appropriate

## Background
The processor incorrectly translates common English words like:
- "chapter" → "prakarana" (unnecessary)
- "practice" → "abhyasa" (context-dependent)
- "peace" → "shantata" (often clearer in English)
- "attachment" → "raga" (duplicates: "raga raga")

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GIVEN** common English words in explanatory text  
   **WHEN** processing the text  
   **THEN** they should remain in English unless in Sanskrit context

2. **GIVEN** the word "attachment" in English context  
   **WHEN** processing  
   **THEN** it should NOT be translated to "raga"

3. **GIVEN** Sanskrit terms that need translation  
   **WHEN** in appropriate context  
   **THEN** apply the correct transliteration

## Technical Details
### Problematic Entries in corrections.yaml
- Line 472: "attachment" in raga variations
- Line 697: "section" in prakarana variations  
- Line 1100: "peace" in shantata variations

### Solution Approach
1. Remove English variations from Sanskrit terms
2. Keep only Sanskrit/Hindi variations
3. Implement context detection before applying translations

## Definition of Done
- [x] Problematic English variations removed from lexicon
- [x] Context detection implemented
- [x] No over-translation of common English words
- [x] Sanskrit terms still correctly transliterated
- [x] Unit tests for context-aware processing

## Test Cases
1. **English context preservation**:
   ```
   Input:  "The chapter on practice brings peace"
   Output: "The chapter on practice brings peace"
   ```

2. **Sanskrit context translation**:
   ```
   Input:  "abhyasa vairagya"
   Output: "abhyāsa vairāgya"
   ```

## QA Notes
- Review all corrections.yaml entries for similar issues
- Test with mixed English-Sanskrit content
- Verify no loss of legitimate corrections
- Check for context boundaries

# Story 7.3: Punctuation Preservation

## Story
**As a** subtitle reader  
**I want** punctuation preserved in Sanskrit term lists  
**So that** the text remains readable and properly formatted

## Background
Current processing removes commas from Sanskrit lists:
- "Raga, bhaya, krodha" becomes "Raga bhaya krodha"
- Lists become harder to read without delimiters

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GIVEN** a comma-separated list of Sanskrit terms  
   **WHEN** applying corrections  
   **THEN** commas must be preserved between terms

2. **GIVEN** punctuation at word boundaries  
   **WHEN** processing words  
   **THEN** punctuation should be maintained in output

## Technical Details
### Root Cause
- Line 513: `clean_word = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', word.lower())`
- Punctuation is stripped before corrections
- Not restored after processing

### Solution Approach
1. Separate punctuation from words before processing
2. Apply corrections to clean words
3. Restore punctuation after corrections

```python
def process_word_with_punctuation(word):
    # Extract leading/trailing punctuation
    match = re.match(r'^(\\W*)(\\w+)(\\W*)$', word)
    if match:
        prefix, clean_word, suffix = match.groups()
        corrected = apply_correction(clean_word)
        return prefix + corrected + suffix
    return word
```

## Definition of Done
- [x] Punctuation preserved in all contexts
- [x] Comma-separated lists maintain structure
- [x] No impact on correction accuracy
- [x] Unit tests for punctuation handling

## Test Cases
1. **List preservation**:
   ```
   Input:  "Raga, bhaya, krodha"
   Output: "Rāga, bhaya, krodha"
   ```

2. **Sentence punctuation**:
   ```
   Input:  "What is dharma?"
   Output: "What is dharma?"
   ```

## QA Notes
- Test with various punctuation marks
- Verify list formatting in subtitles
- Check edge cases with multiple punctuation
- Validate quote handling

# Story 7.4: Context-Aware Processing

## Story
**As a** quality assurance specialist  
**I want** the processor to intelligently detect context before applying corrections  
**So that** corrections are only applied where appropriate

## Background
The processor lacks context awareness, applying corrections blindly without considering whether text is:
- Sanskrit verse requiring transliteration
- English explanation requiring preservation
- Mixed content needing selective processing

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GIVEN** a Sanskrit verse or mantra  
   **WHEN** processing  
   **THEN** apply full transliteration and corrections

2. **GIVEN** English explanatory text  
   **WHEN** processing  
   **THEN** preserve English while correcting only Sanskrit terms

3. **GIVEN** mixed Sanskrit-English content  
   **WHEN** processing  
   **THEN** apply corrections based on confidence thresholds

## Technical Details
### Context Detection Rules
1. **Sanskrit Context Indicators**:
   - Starts with "Om"
   - Contains diacritical marks
   - High density of Sanskrit terms
   - Verse number references (e.g., "2.41")

2. **English Context Indicators**:
   - Common English words predominate
   - Explanatory phrases ("means", "refers to")
   - Question patterns

### Implementation Approach
```python
def detect_context(text):
    sanskrit_score = calculate_sanskrit_density(text)
    if sanskrit_score > 0.7:
        return 'sanskrit'
    elif sanskrit_score < 0.3:
        return 'english'
    else:
        return 'mixed'
```

## Definition of Done
- [x] Context detection algorithm implemented
- [x] Corrections applied based on context
- [x] Confidence thresholds configurable
- [x] No regression in correction accuracy
- [x] Unit tests for various contexts

## Test Cases
1. **Sanskrit verse detection**:
   ```
   Input:  "Om sahana vavatu"
   Context: sanskrit
   Output: "Oṃ sahanā vavatu"
   ```

2. **English explanation detection**:
   ```
   Input:  "This chapter explains the practice"
   Context: english
   Output: "This chapter explains the practice"
   ```

## QA Notes
- Test with various content types
- Verify context boundaries
- Check mixed content handling
- Validate confidence thresholds
