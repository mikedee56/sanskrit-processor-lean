# Story 12.2: Disable Punctuation Enhancement

## Overview
**Priority**: HIGH
**Epic**: Text Processing Quality Restoration
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Problem Statement
The processor is automatically adding punctuation to natural speech, corrupting the transcribed flow. It adds periods after phrases like "thank you" and "namaste", and question marks after sentences starting with "what", "how", etc.

### Evidence
Original transcription flows naturally, but processor adds unwanted punctuation:
- Adds periods after "thank you", "namaste", "om shanti"
- Adds question marks after sentences starting with "what", "how", "why", "when"
- Changes natural speech cadence

## Root Cause Analysis
Located in `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`:

**Line 506**: Punctuation enhancement call in `_normalize_text`
```python
text = self._enhance_punctuation(text)
```

**Lines 510-532**: The problematic enhancement logic
```python
def _enhance_punctuation(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Simplified punctuation enhancement for lean architecture."""
    if self._is_sanskrit_context(text):
        return text

    # Basic punctuation fixes only
    endings = ["thank you", "namaste", "om shanti"]
    for phrase in endings:
        if text.lower().rstrip().endswith(phrase.lower()):
            if not text.rstrip().endswith('.'):
                text = text.rstrip() + '.'
            break

    # Basic question detection
    if any(text.lower().strip().startswith(q) for q in ['what', 'how', 'why', 'when']):
        if not text.rstrip().endswith('?'):
            text = text.rstrip() + '?'

    # Clean spacing (preserve line breaks)
    text = re.sub(r'[ \t]+([.,:;!?])', r'\1', text)
    text = re.sub(r'([.!?])([A-Z])', r'\1 \2', text)

    return text
```

## Solution
1. **Disable punctuation enhancement by default**
2. **Make it configurable** for users who want it
3. **Preserve original transcription punctuation**

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Configuration Control
```yaml
# config.yaml - add under processing section
punctuation_enhancement:
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default for subtitle processing
  preserve_transcription: true  # Keep original punctuation
  auto_periods: false  # Don't add periods automatically
  auto_questions: false  # Don't add question marks automatically
```

### Step 2: Update Enhancement Call
```python
# In _normalize_text method, replace line 506:
# OLD:
text = self._enhance_punctuation(text)

# NEW:
if self.config.get('processing', {}).get('punctuation_enhancement', {}).get('enabled', False):
    text = self._enhance_punctuation(text)
```

### Step 3: Update Enhancement Method
```python
def _enhance_punctuation(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Configurable punctuation enhancement for lean architecture."""
    punct_config = self.config.get('processing', {}).get('punctuation_enhancement', {})

    if self._is_sanskrit_context(text):
        return text

    # Only proceed if enabled
    if not punct_config.get('enabled', False):
        return text

    # Rest of method remains the same but controlled by config...
```

## Alternative: Complete Removal
For immediate fix, simply comment out the enhancement call:
```python
# text = self._enhance_punctuation(text)  # DISABLED: Preserving original transcription
```

## Testing Validation
- Input: "When you meet someone, you say, how are you"
- Current Output: "When you meet someone, you say, how are you?"
- Expected Output: "When you meet someone, you say, how are you" (unchanged)

- Input: "namaste"
- Current Output: "namaste."
- Expected Output: "namaste" (unchanged)

## Files Modified
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`
- `config.yaml`

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Preserves original speech transcription flow
- **Positive**: Eliminates artificial punctuation addition
- **Positive**: More faithful to source audio
- **Risk**: Users who liked auto-punctuation will need to enable it
- **Performance**: Slightly improved (less text processing)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Punctuation enhancement disabled by default
- [x] Configuration option added for optional enabling
- [x] Natural speech preserved without added punctuation
- [x] Existing punctuation from transcription preserved
- [x] All tests pass with original punctuation intact
- [x] User can still enable if desired via config

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4

### Tasks
- [x] Read current sanskrit_processor_v2.py to understand the existing punctuation enhancement implementation
- [x] Read config.yaml to understand current configuration structure
- [x] Add punctuation_enhancement configuration section to config.yaml with proper structure
- [x] Update _normalize_text method to check configuration before calling _enhance_punctuation
- [x] Update _enhance_punctuation method to respect configuration settings
- [x] Test with sample inputs to verify punctuation is preserved
- [x] Run all tests to ensure no regressions

### File List
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py` - Updated _normalize_text and _enhance_punctuation methods
- `config.yaml` - Added punctuation_enhancement configuration section

### Change Log
1. **Added punctuation_enhancement configuration section** in `config.yaml`:
   - `enabled: false` - Disabled by default for subtitle processing
   - `preserve_transcription: true` - Keep original punctuation
   - `auto_periods: false` - Don't add periods automatically
   - `auto_questions: false` - Don't add question marks automatically

2. **Updated _normalize_text method** in `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`:
   - Changed configuration check from `punctuation.enabled` to `processing.punctuation_enhancement.enabled`
   - Added story reference comment (Story 12.2: Disabled by default)

3. **Enhanced _enhance_punctuation method** in `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`:
   - Added configuration-driven control for auto_periods and auto_questions
   - Method now respects individual feature flags within punctuation_enhancement config
   - Preserves original behavior when explicitly enabled

### Completion Notes
- **Validated with test cases**: All story requirements verified with sample inputs
  - "When you meet someone, you say, how are you" → preserved unchanged
  - "namaste" → preserved without period
  - "thank you" → preserved without period
  - "om shanti" → preserved without period
- **Backward compatibility**: Users can still enable punctuation enhancement via config
- **Performance impact**: Slight improvement due to disabled processing by default
- **No regressions**: Basic processing functionality confirmed working

### Debug Log References
None - implementation was straightforward without debugging issues.
