## Dev Notes

### ASR Error Pattern Analysis
**From Test File Analysis** (`engine_0_whisperx_large-v2_WhisperXEngine_large-v2 (16).srt`):

**Critical Missing Corrections**:
1. `yogabashi` → `Yogavāsiṣṭha` (obvious Sanskrit text name)
2. `shivashistha` → `Vaśiṣṭha` (sage name with common ASR error)
3. `malagrasth` → `mala-grasta` (compound word with missing hyphen)
4. `jnana` (31 instances) → `jñāna` (missing diacritical)
5. `utpati` → `utpatti` (double consonant dropped by ASR)
6. `bhoomikaas` → `bhūmikāḥ` (plural form with wrong ending)

### Common ASR Error Categories

#### 1. Phonetic Substitutions
```yaml
# Common patterns where ASR mishears Sanskrit sounds
ph → f     # philosophy → filosophy  
th → t     # dharma → darma
bh → b     # bharata → barata
dh → d     # dharana → darana
v → w      # vasistha → wasistha  
sh → s     # shiva → siva
gya → ya   # gyani → yani
```

#### 2. Case Variations
```yaml
# ASR produces inconsistent capitalization
Yoga Vasistha / yoga vasistha / YOGA VASISTHA
Karma Yoga / karma yoga / KARMA YOGA
Jnana / jnana / JNANA
```

#### 3. Compound Word Issues
```yaml
# ASR handles compound words inconsistently
karma yoga → karma-yoga
maha bharata → mahābhārata
sapta bhoomi → sapta-bhūmi
```

#### 4. Dropped/Added Consonants
```yaml
# ASR drops double consonants or adds extras
utpati → utpatti
vasitta → vasiṣṭha
shivasistha → shivasiṣṭha
```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### ASR Corrections File Structure
```yaml
# lexicons/asr_corrections.yaml
asr_corrections:
  - original_term: yogabashi
    variations:
      - yoga bashi
      - yogavashi
      - yoga vashi
    transliteration: Yogavāsiṣṭha
    is_proper_noun: true
    category: scripture
    confidence: 1.0
    asr_common_error: true
    error_type: phonetic_substitution
    frequency: high
    source_authority: ASR_Pattern_Analysis
    
  - original_term: shivashistha
    variations:
      - shiva shistha
      - sivashistha
      - shivaasistha
    transliteration: Vaśiṣṭha
    is_proper_noun: true

    category: concept
    confidence: 0.95
    asr_common_error: true
    error_type: compound_hyphenation
    frequency: medium
```

#### Database Schema Enhancement
```sql
-- Add ASR-specific columns to existing terms table
ALTER TABLE terms ADD COLUMN asr_common_error BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE terms ADD COLUMN error_type TEXT;
ALTER TABLE terms ADD COLUMN frequency_rating TEXT CHECK (frequency_rating IN ('high', 'medium', 'low'));

-- Create index for ASR lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_asr_errors ON terms (asr_common_error, frequency_rating) 
WHERE asr_common_error = TRUE;
```

#### Enhanced Lexicon Loader
```python
class EnhancedLexiconLoader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.standard_corrections = {}
        self.asr_corrections = {}
        self.phonetic_patterns = {}
        
    def load_asr_corrections(self, asr_file: Path):
        """Load ASR-specific corrections with priority handling."""
        with open(asr_file) as f:
            asr_data = yaml.safe_load(f)
            
        for entry in asr_data['asr_corrections']:
            # Higher priority for ASR entries
            entry['priority'] = 'high' if entry.get('asr_common_error') else 'normal'
            self.asr_corrections[entry['original_term']] = entry
            
    def get_correction(self, term: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
        # Check ASR corrections first (higher priority)
        if term.lower() in self.asr_corrections:
            return self.asr_corrections[term.lower()]
        
        # Fall back to standard corrections
        return self.standard_corrections.get(term.lower())
```

### Expanded Lexicon Entries

#### Major Sanskrit Terms with ASR Variations
```yaml
# Expand existing entries with ASR-specific variations
- original_term: dharma
  variations:
    - darma        # ASR drops 'h'
    - dharama      # ASR adds extra 'a'  
    - DHARMA       # ASR capitalization
    - Dharma       # Mixed case
  transliteration: dharma
  asr_patterns: ['dh→d', 'case_variations']

- original_term: karma
  variations:
    - carma        # ASR c/k confusion
    - karama       # Extra vowel
    - KARMA        # All caps
  transliteration: karma
  asr_patterns: ['k→c', 'vowel_insertion']

- original_term: yogavasistha
  variations:
    - yogabashi      # Common ASR error
    - yoga vasistha  # Space insertion
    - yogawasistha   # v→w substitution
    - yogavasitta    # Double consonant drop
  transliteration: Yogavāsiṣṭha
  asr_patterns: ['compound_error', 'phonetic_substitution']
```

#### Scripture-Specific Terms
```yaml
- original_term: bhagavadgita
  variations:
    - bhagavad gita
    - bagavad gita    # ASR bh→b
    - bhagwad gita    # ASR v→w
    - bhagavat gita   # ASR d→t
  transliteration: Bhagavad-gītā
  category: scripture
  asr_common_error: true

- original_term: mahabharata  
  variations:
    - maha bharata
    - mahabarata     # ASR bh→b
    - mahabharat     # Dropped ending
  transliteration: Mahābhārata
  category: scripture
  asr_common_error: true
```

### File Locations
- **New file**: `/lexicons/asr_corrections.yaml` - ASR-specific corrections
- **Modified**: `/lexicons/hybrid_lexicon_loader.py` - Enhanced loading logic
- **Modified**: `/data/sanskrit_terms.db` - Database schema updates
- **New file**: `/scripts/migrate_asr_corrections.py` - Database migration
- **New file**: `/utils/asr_pattern_analyzer.py` - Pattern analysis tools

### Performance Considerations
**Current Lexicon**: 
- 427 corrections entries
- 381 proper noun entries  
- Load time: ~200ms
- Memory: ~50MB

**Enhanced Lexicon (Projected)**:
- 600+ corrections entries (+200 ASR patterns)
- 500+ proper noun entries (+120 ASR variations)
- Target load time: <1 second
- Target memory: <150MB

**Optimization Strategies**:
1. **Lazy Loading**: Load ASR corrections only when ASR mode enabled
2. **Indexing**: Database indexes for ASR-specific queries
3. **Caching**: In-memory cache for frequently accessed patterns
4. **Priority Queues**: Check ASR patterns before standard corrections

### Expected Coverage Improvement
**Before**: 427 correction entries covering standard Sanskrit terms
**After**: 620+ correction entries covering:
- Standard Sanskrit terms
- 200+ ASR error patterns  
- Case variations for all major terms
- Phonetic approximations
- Compound word variations
- Scripture-specific transcription errors

**Impact on Test File**:
- Current: 6 corrections (1.2%) in enhanced mode
- Expected: 150+ corrections (30%+) with ASR patterns
- All major errors corrected: yogabashi, jnana, shivashistha, etc.
