# Story 8.4: Testing Framework Setup and Execution

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** Sanskrit text processor developer,  
**I want** a functional testing framework that can execute the existing 22 test files,  
**so that** quality assurance claims can be validated and regressions can be prevented.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GIVEN** the existing 22 test files in the tests directory  
   **WHEN** running pytest  
   **THEN** all tests should execute without import errors or missing dependencies

2. **GIVEN** the testing framework is properly configured  
   **WHEN** running the full test suite  
   **THEN** test results should provide clear pass/fail status for quality validation

3. **GIVEN** test coverage requirements  
   **WHEN** running tests with coverage reporting  
   **THEN** coverage metrics should be generated for core processing functions

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Install and configure testing framework (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install pytest and pytest-cov packages
  - [x] Configure pytest configuration file (pytest.ini or pyproject.toml)
  - [x] Verify requirements.txt includes testing dependencies

- [x] Task 2: Fix test import and dependency issues (AC: 1)
  - [x] Resolve any missing module imports in test files
  - [x] Fix path issues for test file execution
  - [x] Ensure test data files are accessible

- [x] Task 3: Validate existing test suite functionality (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Run each test file individually to identify issues
  - [x] Fix any broken tests due to code changes
  - [x] Document test execution results and coverage

- [x] Task 4: Set up test coverage reporting (AC: 3)
  - [x] Configure coverage reporting for core modules
  - [x] Generate baseline coverage report
  - [x] Identify areas with insufficient test coverage

- [x] Task 5: Create test execution automation (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create script for running full test suite
  - [x] Set up continuous integration test execution
  - [x] Document test execution procedures

- [x] Task 6: Validate quality assurance claims (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Run tests to validate processing accuracy claims
  - [x] Execute performance tests to validate speed claims
  - [x] Generate comprehensive test report

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From the architectural analysis, pytest is not installed despite being in requirements.txt, making the existing 22 test files unexecutable. This blocks validation of quality assurance and performance claims.

### Current Testing Situation [Source: Architectural Analysis]
- **Test Files Count**: 22 test files exist in tests/ directory
- **pytest Status**: Not installed (`/usr/bin/python3: No module named pytest`)
- **Requirements**: pytest>=7.0.0 and pytest-cov>=4.0.0 listed in requirements.txt
- **Test Coverage**: Currently unverifiable due to execution issues

### Existing Test Structure [Source: File Analysis]
```
tests/
├── test_compound_recognition.py        # Compound term processing tests
├── test_config_integration.py          # Configuration system tests  
├── test_context_aware_processing.py    # Context-aware pipeline tests
├── test_database_integration.py        # Database functionality tests
├── test_performance_monitoring.py      # Performance measurement tests
├── test_quality_assurance.py          # QA framework tests
├── test_sacred_content_preservation.py # Sacred text handling tests
└── ... (15 more test files)
```

### Dependencies and Setup [Source: architecture/brownfield-architecture.md]
- **Testing Framework**: pytest (as per requirements.txt)
- **Coverage Tool**: pytest-cov (for coverage reporting)
- **Test Standards**: Unit tests and integration tests
- **Performance Tests**: Included in existing test suite

### File Locations [Source: architecture/brownfield-architecture.md]  
- **Requirements**: `requirements.txt` (contains pytest dependencies)
- **Test Directory**: `tests/` (22 test files)
- **Core Modules**: `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`, `cli.py`, `enhanced_processor.py`
- **Test Configuration**: Need to create `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml`

### Testing Standards Implementation
```python
# Expected pytest configuration
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
python_files = "test_*.py"
python_functions = "test_*"
addopts = "--cov=sanskrit_processor_v2 --cov=cli --cov=enhanced_processor --cov-report=html --cov-report=term"
```

### Quality Assurance Validation [Source: Architectural Analysis]
- **Quality Score Claims**: Need to validate 95%+ quality score claims
- **Performance Claims**: Need to validate 2,600+ segments/second
- **Sacred Content**: Validate sacred text preservation claims
- **Database Integration**: Validate 9,057+ terms integration

### Technical Constraints [Source: architecture/brownfield-architecture.md]
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep testing dependencies minimal
- **Cross-platform**: Tests must work on Windows and Linux
- **Performance**: Tests should not significantly slow development
- **Coverage Target**: Achieve reasonable coverage of core functions

### Test Execution Strategy
1. **Installation**: `pip install pytest pytest-cov`
2. **Individual Test Validation**: Run each test file to identify issues
3. **Full Suite Execution**: `pytest tests/ --cov`
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Review coverage reports for gaps
5. **Integration Validation**: Test with real SRT files

### Expected Outcomes
- **Test Results**: Clear pass/fail status for all 22 test files
- **Coverage Report**: HTML and terminal coverage reports
- **Quality Validation**: Verification of processing accuracy claims
- **Performance Baseline**: Benchmark results for optimization work
