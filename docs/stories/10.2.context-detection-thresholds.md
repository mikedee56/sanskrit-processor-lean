# Story 10.2: Context Detection Threshold Adjustment

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Sanskrit processor developer  
**I want** configurable context detection thresholds  
**So that** English protection doesn't block legitimate Sanskrit corrections in ASR-generated content

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Configurable Thresholds**: English detection confidence threshold configurable in config.yaml (default 0.8)
2. **Mixed Content Control**: Mixed content processing threshold configurable (default 0.5)
3. **Sanskrit Whitelist Override**: Protection bypassed for whitelisted Sanskrit terms regardless of context
4. **Debug Visibility**: Context detection decisions logged with `--debug-context` flag
5. **Expandable Markers**: Sanskrit and English marker lists configurable via configuration
6. **Granular Control**: Per-segment context detection override capability
7. **Performance Maintained**: Context detection overhead < 5% of total processing time

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Refactor ContextDetector class** (AC: 1, 2)

## Dev Notes

### Current Problem Analysis
**Root Cause**: Enhanced processor in `enhanced_processor.py` lines 226-234 has overly aggressive English protection:

```python
if context_result.context_type == 'english':
    # English context: Pass through unchanged (ZERO MODIFICATIONS)
    logger.debug(f"English context detected, bypassing all processing")
    return text, 0
```

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Low Threshold**: Current system detects English too easily in mixed content
2. **Binary Decision**: No nuanced handling of mixed Sanskrit/English segments  
3. **No Override**: Known Sanskrit terms blocked even when corrections are obvious
4. **Fixed Markers**: Hardcoded English word list includes common words that appear in Sanskrit contexts

### Context Detection Issues in ASR Files
**Sample from test file analysis**:
- Segment: "That's called jnana" ‚Üí Detected as English, `jnana` not corrected to `j√±ƒÅna`
- Segment: "Karma Yoga allows your karma" ‚Üí Mixed content, "Karma" should be corrected
- Segment: "yogabashi themes" ‚Üí Should correct `yogabashi` to `YogavƒÅsi·π£·π≠ha` despite English words

### Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Enhanced Context Configuration
```yaml
context_detection:
  thresholds:
    english_confidence: 0.8      # Increased from ~0.3
    sanskrit_confidence: 0.6     # Confidence for Sanskrit detection
    mixed_content: 0.5           # Threshold for mixed processing
    whitelist_override: 0.9      # High confidence override threshold
  
  markers:
    sanskrit_priority_terms:
      - dharma
      - karma  
      - yoga
      - jnana
      - brahman
      - guru
      - mantra
      - yogavasistha
      - shivashistha
    
    english_function_words:
      - the
      - and
      - is
      - are
      # Reduced list - remove words that commonly appear with Sanskrit
    
  processing:
    enable_whitelist_override: true
    debug_logging: false
    cache_context_results: true
    performance_profiling: false
```

#### ContextConfig Dataclass
```python
@dataclass
class ContextConfig:
    english_threshold: float = 0.8
    sanskrit_threshold: float = 0.6
    mixed_threshold: float = 0.5
    whitelist_override_threshold: float = 0.9
    
    sanskrit_priority_terms: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    english_function_words: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    
    enable_whitelist_override: bool = True
    debug_logging: bool = False
    cache_results: bool = True
```

#### Enhanced Context Detection Logic
```python
def detect_context_with_override(self, text: str) -> ContextResult:
    # Standard context detection
    base_result = self.detect_base_context(text)
    
    # Check for Sanskrit whitelist override
    if self.config.enable_whitelist_override:
        for priority_term in self.config.sanskrit_priority_terms:
            if priority_term.lower() in text.lower():
                # Override to Sanskrit processing for priority terms
                return ContextResult(
                    context_type='sanskrit',
                    confidence=self.config.whitelist_override_threshold,
                    markers_found=[priority_term],
                    override_reason='sanskrit_whitelist'
                )
    
    return base_result
```

### File Locations
- **Modified**: `enhanced_processor.py` - Context detection logic (lines 226-270)
- **Modified**: `config.yaml` - Add context_detection section
- **New file**: `processors/context_config.py` - Configuration dataclass
- **New file**: `lexicons/sanskrit_priority_terms.yaml` - High-priority terms
- **Modified**: `cli.py` - Add `--debug-context` flag

### Expected Behavior Changes

#### Before (Current Behavior):
```
Input: "That's called jnana and karma yoga practice"
Context Detection: ENGLISH (high confidence due to "that's", "called", "and")
Processing: BYPASS - no corrections applied
Output: "That's called jnana and karma yoga practice"
```

#### After (With Threshold Adjustment):
```
Input: "That's called jnana and karma yoga practice"
Context Detection: MIXED (jnana, karma detected as Sanskrit priority terms)  
Processing: SELECTIVE - correct Sanskrit terms only
Output: "That's called j√±ƒÅna and karma-yoga practice"
```

### Debug Output Example
With `--debug-context` flag:
```
üîç CONTEXT DETECTION DEBUG:
Segment: "yogabashi is one of the most highlighted themes"
Markers found:
  - English: [is, one, of, the, most] (confidence: 0.7)  
  - Sanskrit: [yogabashi] (priority term detected)
Base detection: ENGLISH (0.7)
Whitelist override: YES - yogabashi is priority term
Final decision: SANSKRIT (0.9 - whitelist override)
Processing: FULL Sanskrit pipeline applied
Result: "YogavƒÅsi·π£·π≠ha is one of the most highlighted themes"
```

### Testing Strategy
1. **Threshold Testing**: Vary thresholds from 0.3 to 0.9, measure correction rates
2. **Whitelist Validation**: Ensure priority terms always get processed  
3. **Mixed Content**: Test balanced Sanskrit/English segments
4. **Performance Impact**: Measure context detection overhead
5. **Debug Output**: Validate debug logging accuracy and usefulness

### Configuration Examples

#### Conservative (High Accuracy)
```yaml
context_detection:
  thresholds:
    english_confidence: 0.9  # Very high bar for English detection
    sanskrit_confidence: 0.3  # Low bar for Sanskrit detection
```

#### Aggressive (High Coverage)  
```yaml
context_detection:
  thresholds:
    english_confidence: 0.6  # Lower bar allows more corrections
    sanskrit_confidence: 0.7  # Higher confidence required for Sanskrit
```

#### ASR Optimized (Recommended)
```yaml
context_detection:
  thresholds:
    english_confidence: 0.8  # Balanced for mixed content
    sanskrit_confidence: 0.6  # Appropriate for ASR variations
    whitelist_override: 0.95  # Strong override for known terms
```

## Testing

### Test File Location
`/tests/test_context_detection.py`

### Test Framework  
- **pytest** for test execution
- **Mock context scenarios** for controlled testing
- **Real ASR samples** for validation

### Specific Test Requirements

1. **Threshold Configuration Tests**
   - Configuration loading and validation
   - Invalid threshold values rejected (< 0.0 or > 1.0)
   - Default values applied when config missing
   - Threshold changes affect detection behavior

2. **Sanskrit Whitelist Override Tests**
   - Priority terms bypass English protection
   - Whitelist loading from YAML file
   - Case-insensitive whitelist matching
   - Multiple priority terms in same segment

3. **Context Detection Accuracy Tests**
   - Pure English segments detected correctly
   - Pure Sanskrit segments detected correctly  
   - Mixed content handled appropriately
   - Edge cases (single words, punctuation)

4. **Debug Logging Tests**
   - `--debug-context` flag enables detailed logging
   - Confidence scores reported accurately
   - Marker detection logged correctly
   - Override decisions explained clearly

5. **Performance Tests**
   - Context detection overhead < 5% of total time
   - Large file processing within performance bounds
   - Caching improves repeated segment performance
   - Memory usage remains stable
