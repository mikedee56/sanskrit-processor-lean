# Story 12.1: Remove Number Word Conversion Bug

## Overview
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Epic**: Text Processing Quality Restoration
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Problem Statement
The processor is converting spoken number words ("one", "two", "three") to digits ("1", "2", "3") in natural speech, which corrupts subtitle text. This is inappropriate for speech transcription processing.

### Evidence
```
Original: "one without a second, vast as the ether"
Output:   "1 without a second, vast as the ether"
```

This breaks the natural flow of spiritual discourse and philosophical explanations.

## Root Cause Analysis
Located in `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`:

**Lines 250-255**: Number words dictionary definition
```python
self.number_words = {
    'one': '1', 'two': '2', 'three': '3', 'four': '4', 'five': '5',
    'six': '6', 'seven': '7', 'eight': '8', 'nine': '9', 'ten': '10',
    'eleven': '11', 'twelve': '12', 'thirteen': '13', 'fourteen': '14', 'fifteen': '15',
    'sixteen': '16', 'seventeen': '17', 'eighteen': '18'
}
```

**Lines 497-498**: Active conversion logic
```python
for word, digit in self.number_words.items():
    text = re.sub(rf'\b{re.escape(word)}\b', digit, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

## Solution
1. **Remove the number_words dictionary entirely** from `__init__` method
2. **Remove the conversion loop** from `_normalize_text` method
3. **Add configuration option** for number conversion (disabled by default)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Remove Number Word Dictionary
```python
# DELETE these lines from __init__ method (lines 250-255)
# self.number_words = {
#     'one': '1', 'two': '2', 'three': '3', 'four': '4', 'five': '5',
#     'six': '6', 'seven': '7', 'eight': '8', 'nine': '9', 'ten': '10',
#     'eleven': '11', 'twelve': '12', 'thirteen': '13', 'fourteen': '14', 'fifteen': '15',
#     'sixteen': '16', 'seventeen': '17', 'eighteen': '18'
# }
```

### Step 2: Remove Conversion Logic
```python
# DELETE these lines from _normalize_text method (lines 497-498)
# for word, digit in self.number_words.items():
#     text = re.sub(rf'\b{re.escape(word)}\b', digit, text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
```

### Step 3: Add Configuration Option (Optional)
```yaml
# config.yaml - add under processing section
number_conversion:
  enabled: false  # Disabled by default for subtitle processing
  context_aware: true  # Only convert in specific contexts if enabled
```

## Testing Validation
- Input: "one without a second, vast as the ether"
- Expected: "one without a second, vast as the ether" (unchanged)
- Input: "three gunas and their modifications"
- Expected: "three gunas and their modifications" (unchanged)

## Files Modified
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py`
- `config.yaml` (optional configuration)

## Impact Assessment
- **Positive**: Preserves natural speech flow in subtitles
- **Positive**: Eliminates text corruption in philosophical discourse
- **Risk**: None - this feature was inappropriate for the use case
- **Performance**: Slightly improved (fewer regex operations)

## Definition of Done
- [x] Number word dictionary removed from processor
- [x] Conversion logic removed from normalization
- [x] Test with sample file shows no number word conversion
- [x] Configuration option added for future use cases
- [x] All existing tests pass
- [x] Natural speech flows preserved in output

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
None - clean implementation without issues

### Completion Notes List
- Successfully removed `number_words` dictionary from `__init__` method (lines 250-255)
- Successfully removed conversion logic from `_normalize_text` method (lines 497-498)
- Added `number_conversion` configuration section to `config.yaml` with `enabled: false` default
- Verified with test file that number words ("one", "three", "five") remain unchanged in output
- Module syntax validation and import tests successful
- Basic functionality test confirmed working correctly

### File List
- `sanskrit_processor_v2.py` - Removed number word dictionary and conversion logic
- `config.yaml` - Added number_conversion configuration option

### Change Log
1. **sanskrit_processor_v2.py Line 250-255**: Removed `number_words` dictionary definition from `__init__` method
2. **sanskrit_processor_v2.py Line 497-498**: Removed number word conversion loop from `_normalize_text` method
3. **config.yaml Line 20-23**: Added `number_conversion` configuration section with `enabled: false` and `context_aware: true`

### Status
Ready for Review

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Exceptional implementation quality. The removal of number word conversion follows the project's lean architecture philosophy perfectly - clean code removal with proper configuration support. The implementation is straightforward, well-documented, and addresses the critical user experience issue effectively.

**Key Strengths:**
- Clean removal of problematic feature without architectural disruption
- Proper configuration option added for future flexibility
- Performance improvement (fewer regex operations)
- Maintains all existing functionality while fixing the bug

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The developer's implementation was already clean and following best practices.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows project conventions and lean architecture
- Project Structure: ✓ Proper configuration management and file organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Manual functional testing with representative data
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

[All items addressed by developer during implementation]

- [x] Number word dictionary removed from processor initialization
- [x] Conversion logic removed from text normalization
- [x] Configuration option added with disabled default
- [x] Functional testing with philosophical discourse examples
- [x] All existing processing functionality preserved
- [x] Performance optimized (reduced regex operations)

### Security Review

No security concerns. This change removes functionality rather than adding it, reducing attack surface. Configuration management follows existing secure patterns.

### Performance Considerations

**Positive Impact:** Removal of number word conversion loop reduces regex operations, improving processing speed. Verified through functional testing showing normal processing performance maintained.

### Files Modified During Review

No files modified during review - implementation was already optimal.

### Gate Status
