# Epic 8: Critical Infrastructure Fixes

## Epic Overview
**Goal**: Fix critical architectural issues discovered in forensic analysis that prevent the Sanskrit Processor from operating at claimed performance and reliability levels.

## Background
A comprehensive architectural analysis revealed severe gaps between claimed and actual system performance, along with critical infrastructure issues that compromise system reliability. Despite claims of "everything working perfectly," the system has:

- **55x Performance Gap**: 47 vs 2,600+ segments/second claimed
- **Database Schema Mismatch**: 9,057 terms exist but are unqueryable due to column mismatches  
- **Overtranslation Bug**: "srimad bhagavatam" → "Śrīmad Śrīmad Bhāgavatam" (duplication)
- **Testing Framework Broken**: 22 test files exist but pytest not installed

## Stories

### 🔴 Story 8.1: Database Schema Alignment Fix (Critical)
**Priority**: HIGHEST - Blocks database integration entirely  
**Impact**: 9,057 Sanskrit terms in database are currently unusable  
**Effort**: 2 hours  

Fix SQL column name mismatches between database schema (`original_term`) and code expectations (`term`, `corrected_term`).

### 🔴 Story 8.2: Overtranslation Bug Fix (Critical)
**Priority**: HIGH - Produces incorrect output  
**Impact**: Compound terms are double-processed causing duplicates  
**Effort**: 3 hours  

Fix compound processing pipeline to prevent double-application of corrections.

### 🟡 Story 8.3: Performance Optimization (Major)  
**Priority**: MEDIUM - System is 55x slower than claimed  
**Impact**: Processing speed is 47 vs 2,600+ segments/second  
**Effort**: 4 hours  

Profile and optimize processing pipeline to achieve realistic performance targets.

### 🟡 Story 8.4: Testing Framework Setup (Major)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Blocks quality validation  
**Impact**: Cannot verify quality assurance or performance claims  
**Effort**: 2 hours  

Install pytest and fix test execution to validate system quality.

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **Database Integration**: 9,057 terms successfully queryable
- **Overtranslation**: Zero duplicate corrections (e.g., "Śrīmad Śrīmad")
- **Processing Speed**: Achieve 2,000+ segments/second (realistic target)
- **Test Execution**: All 22 test files executable with pytest

### Quality Gates
