# Enhancement: Post-Processing Laughter & Artifact Filter

**Status**: Approved for Implementation
**Date**: 2025-10-01
**Architect**: Winston
**Type**: Pipeline Enhancement (No ADR Required)
**Effort**: ~5 hours
**Complexity**: Low

---

## Problem Statement

ASR systems (Whisper, WhisperX) frequently generate transcription artifacts that degrade output quality:

1. **Laughter artifacts**: "ha ha", "haha", "[Laughter]", "(laughs)"
2. **Phantom phrases**: YouTube-style auto-caption artifacts like "Thank you for watching"
3. **Sound annotations**: "[Music]", "(applause)", "[silence]"
4. **Excessive punctuation**: "!!!!", "????"

These artifacts clutter transcripts and reduce professional quality, especially in lecture/spiritual content where clean text is critical.

---

## Solution: Post-Processing Filter

**Approach**: Add final cleanup step in processing pipeline to remove known ASR artifacts using pattern matching.

**Integration Point**: Line ~2045 in `process_srt_file()`, after all text processing but before writing output.

**Architecture Pattern**: Pipeline filter (consistent with existing mantra standardization)

## Implementation Specification

### Core Class: `LaughterArtifactFilter`

```python
# processors/artifact_filter.py

class LaughterArtifactFilter:
    """Removes common ASR artifacts from transcribed text."""

    def __init__(self, config: dict = None):
        self.enabled = config.get('enable_artifact_filter', True)
        self.patterns = self._build_patterns()  # 6 pattern types
        self.stats = {'total_removed': 0, 'by_type': {}}

    def filter_segment(
        self,
        text: str,
        duration: float = 0.0,
        prev_text: str = "",
        next_text: str = ""
    ) -> Tuple[str, int]:
        """
        Filter artifacts from segment.

        Returns: (filtered_text, artifacts_removed_count)
        """
        # Apply pattern matching with duration/context rules
        # Clean up whitespace and empty punctuation
        # Return cleaned text + removal count
```

### Artifact Patterns (6 Types)

| Pattern Type | Regex | Duration Rule | Context Check |
|--------------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| **Repetitive ha** | `\b(ha\s*){2,}\b` | None | No |
| **Bracketed laughter** | `\[(laugh\|laughter)\]` | None | No |
| **Phantom "thank you for watching"** | `thank you for watching` | <2.0s | No |
| **Standalone "thank you"** | `^(thank you\|thanks)$` | <1.5s | **Yes** |
| **Music/sound annotations** | `\[(music\|applause)\]` | None | No |
| **Excessive punctuation** | `([!?]){3,}` | None | No |

### Duration-Based Filtering

**Logic**: Some phrases are artifacts only when very short in duration.

**Example**:
- `"Thank you for watching"` in 1.2s → **Remove** (phantom phrase)
- `"Thank you for watching this entire lecture series"` in 4.5s → **Keep** (genuine)

**Implementation**:
```python
if pattern_def.min_duration > 0 and duration >= pattern_def.min_duration:
    continue  # Skip pattern (segment too long for artifact)
```

### Context-Aware Filtering

**Logic**: Validate ambiguous patterns using surrounding segments.

**Example**:
- Segment N-1: `"ha ha ha"` (laughter)
- Segment N: `"Thank you."` (1.0s)
- Segment N+1: `""` (empty)
- **Decision**: Remove (likely artifact after laughter)

**Implementation**:
```python
def _should_remove_contextual(self, text, prev_text, next_text):
    # If surrounded by empty segments or laughter → artifact
    # If very short and standalone → artifact
    # Otherwise → keep
```

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Initialization (`SanskritProcessor.__init__()`)

```python
# Add to existing __init__
if config and config.get('enable_artifact_filter', False):
    from processors.artifact_filter import LaughterArtifactFilter
    self.artifact_filter = LaughterArtifactFilter(config)
else:
    self.artifact_filter = None
```

### 2. Processing Pipeline (`process_srt_file()` line ~2045)

```python
# After processing loop, before writing phase:

# NEW: Post-processing artifact filter
if self.artifact_filter:
    artifacts_removed = 0

    for i, segment in enumerate(segments):
        duration = (segment.end_time - segment.start_time).total_seconds()
        prev_text = segments[i-1].text if i > 0 else ""
        next_text = segments[i+1].text if i < len(segments) - 1 else ""

        filtered_text, removed = self.artifact_filter.filter_segment(
            segment.text, duration, prev_text, next_text
        )

        segment.text = filtered_text
        artifacts_removed += removed

    logger.info(f"Artifact filter: Removed {artifacts_removed} artifacts")
```

### 3. Configuration (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
# Artifact Filtering (Post-Processing)
enable_artifact_filter: true  # Feature flag (default: false for opt-in)

artifact_filter:
  remove_laughter: true
  remove_phantom_phrases: true
  remove_sound_annotations: true
  normalize_punctuation: true

  # Duration thresholds (seconds)
  phantom_phrase_max_duration: 2.0
  standalone_thanks_max_duration: 1.5
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (`tests/test_artifact_filter.py`)

```python
def test_laughter_removal():
    """Verify laughter patterns removed correctly."""
    filter = LaughterArtifactFilter()

    assert filter.filter_segment("ha ha ha funny")[0] == "funny"
    assert filter.filter_segment("Great [Laughter] yes")[0] == "Great  yes"

def test_duration_based_filtering():
    """Verify duration constraints work."""
    filter = LaughterArtifactFilter()

    # Short duration - remove
    text, removed = filter.filter_segment("Thank you for watching", duration=1.5)
    assert text == ""

    # Long duration - keep
    text, removed = filter.filter_segment("Thank you for watching", duration=3.5)
    assert "thank you" in text.lower()

def test_context_aware_filtering():
    """Verify context validation prevents false positives."""
    filter = LaughterArtifactFilter()

    # After laughter - remove
    text, _ = filter.filter_segment(
        "Thank you.", duration=1.0, prev_text="ha ha ha"
    )
    assert text == ""

    # In genuine context - keep
    text, _ = filter.filter_segment(
        "Thank you for your question.",
        duration=2.5,
        prev_text="So the answer is...",
        next_text="Let me explain."
    )
    assert "thank you" in text.lower()
```

### Integration Test

```python
def test_end_to_end_filtering():
    """Full SRT processing with artifact filter enabled."""
    processor = SanskritProcessor(
        config={'enable_artifact_filter': True}
    )

    result = processor.process_srt_file(
        "tests/fixtures/lecture_with_laughter.srt",
        "tests/output/cleaned.srt"
    )

    # Verify artifacts removed
    stats = processor.artifact_filter.get_statistics()
    assert stats['total_artifacts_removed'] > 0
    assert 'repetitive_ha' in stats['by_pattern_type']
```

---

## Performance Impact

**Expected Overhead**: <5ms per segment (negligible)

**Complexity**:
- Pattern matching: O(n) where n = segment length
- Context checking: O(1) (only adjacent segments)
- Total per file: O(segments * avg_segment_length)

**Benchmark Target**:
- 1,000 segments: <5 seconds additional processing
- No impact on existing 2,600 seg/s throughput (post-processing only)

**Monitoring**:
```python
# Log filtering statistics
logger.info(f"Artifact filter: Removed {artifacts_removed} artifacts in {filter_time:.2f}s")
for pattern_type, count in stats['by_pattern_type'].items():
    logger.debug(f"  {pattern_type}: {count}")
```

---

## Configuration Options

### Feature Flag (Master Switch)

```yaml
enable_artifact_filter: false  # Default: disabled (opt-in)
```

**Rationale**: Conservative rollout, users explicitly enable for their use case.

### Pattern-Specific Toggles

```yaml
artifact_filter:
  remove_laughter: true          # ha ha, [laugh]
  remove_phantom_phrases: true   # "thank you for watching"
  remove_sound_annotations: true # [music], (applause)
  normalize_punctuation: true    # !!!! → !
```

### Threshold Tuning

```yaml
artifact_filter:
  # Duration thresholds (seconds)
  phantom_phrase_max_duration: 2.0    # Adjust based on content type
  standalone_thanks_max_duration: 1.5

  # Context sensitivity
  require_context_check: true  # Enable context-aware validation
```

---

## Quality Metrics

### Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Laughter Removal Accuracy** | 95%+ | Manual review of 100 segments |
| **Phantom Phrase Removal** | 90%+ | Duration + context validation |
| **False Positive Rate** | <1% | Genuine content incorrectly removed |
| **Processing Overhead** | <5ms/seg | Performance profiling |
| **Configuration Flexibility** | 100% | All patterns independently toggleable |

### Monitoring

**Real-Time Statistics**:
```python
stats = {
    'total_artifacts_removed': 42,
    'by_pattern_type': {
        'repetitive_ha': 15,
        'bracketed_laughter': 12,
        'phantom_thanks_watching': 8,
        'music_annotations': 5,
        'excessive_punctuation': 2
    }
}
```

**Logging**:
- INFO: Total artifacts removed per file
- DEBUG: Pattern-by-pattern breakdown
- WARNING: If >50% of segments filtered (possible over-filtering)

---

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Opt-In Testing (Week 1)

- Feature flag default: `false` (disabled)
- Documentation: How to enable in config.yaml
- User testing with lecture content (yoga, spiritual talks)
- Collect feedback on false positives/negatives

### Phase 2: Refinement (Week 2)

- Tune duration thresholds based on feedback
- Expand pattern database if new artifact types discovered
- Add custom pattern support (user-defined regexes)

### Phase 3: Recommended Default (Week 3+)

- If false positive rate <1%, consider default: `true`
- Provide easy disable option for users who prefer raw ASR output
- Document known limitations and edge cases

---

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **False positives** (genuine content removed) | High | Medium | Context validation, duration thresholds, manual review sample |
| **Over-aggressive filtering** | Medium | Low | Pattern-specific toggles, conservative defaults |
| **Performance degradation** | Low | Low | Simple regex, <5ms overhead target |
| **Maintenance burden** | Low | Medium | Pattern database in config (user-editable), no code changes needed |

---

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: ML-Based Artifact Detection

**Pros**: Can learn new artifact types automatically
**Cons**: Over-engineered, requires training data, slower inference
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Pattern-based approach sufficient for known artifacts

### Alternative 2: Pre-Processing (During ASR)

**Pros**: Prevents artifacts from entering pipeline
**Cons**: Not feasible (ASR is external/upstream), harder to validate
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Post-processing provides better control and validation

### Alternative 3: Manual Review/Editing

**Pros**: 100% accuracy with human review
**Cons**: Not scalable, labor-intensive
**Decision**: ❌ Rejected - Need automated solution

### Selected Approach: Post-Processing Pattern Filter

**Rationale**:
- Simple, maintainable implementation (~200 lines)
- Configurable and extensible (pattern database)
- Safe (can be disabled, no upstream changes)
- Effective (95%+ removal rate with <1% false positives)
