## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** for each new architectural decision
2. **Use ADR numbering**: ADR-001, ADR-002, etc.
3. **Update status** as the decision evolves through its lifecycle
4. **Keep it concise** but comprehensive - aim for 1-3 pages
5. **Include stakeholders** in the review process before marking as "Accepted"
6. **Link related ADRs** to maintain architectural coherence
7. **Review regularly** - architecture decisions should evolve with the system

### Status Lifecycle
- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered
- **Accepted**: Decision has been approved and is being implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer current but may still be in effect
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

### Best Practices
- Write ADRs when architectural decisions have long-term impact
- Include both technical and business stakeholders in decision process
- Document the decision rationale, not just the decision itself
- Update related documentation when ADRs are accepted
- Review ADRs periodically to ensure they remain relevant
