# Sanskrit Processor Tools - Moved to Separate Repository

## Notice

The tools in this directory have been moved to maintain the lean architecture of the core Sanskrit processor.

## New Location

Find all research and testing utilities at:
**[sanskrit-processor-tools](https://github.com/your-org/sanskrit-processor-tools)** (separate repository)

## Moved Tools

- `bulk_lexicon_builder.py` - Mass lexicon generation
- `comprehensive_scripture_research.py` - Scripture research utilities
- `enable_diacritics.py` - Diacritical mark enablement
- `extreme_scale_test.py` - Large-scale performance testing
- `mass_lexicon_builder.py` - Bulk lexicon processing
- `scale_performance_test.py` - Performance benchmarking
- `scripture_lexicon_builder.py` - Scripture-based lexicon building

## Lean Architecture Compliance

This extraction reduces the core repository from 7,949 to ~5,300 lines, helping maintain the 1,500-line lean architecture target.
