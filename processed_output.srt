00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Namaste everyone, today we will study the profound teachings of Kṛṣṇa

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
from the Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 about dharma and the eternal soul

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna in verse 2 47, karmany eva adhikaram te

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
ma phaleshu kadachana, you have the right to perform actions but never

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to the fruits of action, this is the essence of nishkama karma

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the concept of ahimsa, non-violence, is fundamental in yoga philosophy

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
when we practice prāṇāyāma and meditation, we purify the chitta

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the ultimate goal is moksha, liberation from the cycle of samsara

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
as taught in the Upaniṣads, tat tvam asi, thou art that

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
through sadhana and devotion to guru, we realize our true nature as ātman
