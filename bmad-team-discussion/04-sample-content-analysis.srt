1
00:00:03,153 --> 00:00:04,153
Hari Om Vatsal.

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:05,657
Happy Janmashtami.

3
00:00:06,718 --> 00:00:16,612
On the sacred occasion of Lord Kṛṣṇa's birthday, let's open our heart and immerse ourselves in the divine Leela of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

24
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:14,395
And 1 by 1, he killed 6 of their children.

25
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,162
The seventh child was about to be born.

27
00:02:22,608 --> 00:02:30,879
Incarnation of Sheshna, a cosmic serpent with thousand of fruits.

28
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:41,936
At this time, Lord Viṣṇu instructed Yogmaya, the Devi of cosmic illusion, to descend on earth and transfer Balram from Devaki's womb to Rohini's womb.

69
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,629
Now let's get into the mystic meaning behind Kṛṣṇa's birth story.

73
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:47,659
that we should not think about these stories that it happened in a particular Yoga, in a particular setting and we distance ourselves from these stories.

95
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:10,831
But when that aspiration dawns in the aspirant's heart, the celestial voice is heard and it sends challenge to the ego that is overpowered by ignorance.

101
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:31,451
He killed all the 6 children.

137
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:23,772
first and foremost, Kṛṣṇa's birth represents the birth of spiritual aspiration deep within the heart of a sincere aspirant.

146
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:39,134
And this has been beautifully explained by our Pujya Gurudev, Swami Jyotirmayanandaji, in the form of integral Yoga, which in a simple term is be good, do good, love, serve, meditate, and ultimately realize our absolute self, our real potential.

158
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:10,123
Let us make ourselves deserving so that we can joyously celebrate festival of Janmashtami every day within our own heart.

161
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,583
Hari Om Tat Sat Happy Janmashtami.
