1
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:55,615
Om Neelambuja Shyaamala Komalaangam
Sita Samaaropita Vaama Bhaa gam. 

2
00:00:55,615 --> 00:01:04,331
Paanow Mahasaayaka Chaaru Chaapam
Namami Ramam Raghuwansha Naatham.

3
00:01:05,116 --> 00:01:11,280
Adorations to Lord Rama,
whose complexion is like a blue lotus, 

4
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:20,320
who is very tender and delightful in appearance.
Sita is seated on his left side, 

5
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,600
and he is carrying a powerful 
bow and arrow in his hands.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:41,760
We continue in Balakanda of Ramayana,
verses 31 onwards.

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:54,240
Swami Tulsidas, the author of the Ramayana,
is still in the process of introducing his work, 

8
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,240
and that process itself is a 
foundation of the Ramayana.

9
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,548
Presently, describing glory of the mantra ‘Rama.’

10
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:18,468
maṁtra mahāmani biṣāya byala ke,
meṭata kathina kuaṁka bhāla ke. 

11
00:02:18,468 --> 00:02:28,240
harana moha tama dinakara kara se,
sevaka sali pāla jaladhara se.

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:40,160
For removing the poison of 
the snake of vishayarasa,  

13
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:49,520
Rama is the great mantra and a mystical jewel.

14
00:02:49,520 --> 00:03:00,880
When bitten by a snake, ancient people used to 
recite mantras to neutralize this snake poison.

15
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:09,440
Also, they applied certain jewel that 
was specially charged in a spiritual way— 

16
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:17,120
that's an old time remedy for snake poison.

17
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,680
Here the snake poison is vishayarasa.

18
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Try to understand ‘rasa’—'rasa' is taste.

19
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,680
You live in the world process 
that has three planes: 

20
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,160
Physical plane—bhur-loka.
The rasa of bhur-loka is gross— 

21
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,120
the taste that you enjoy by eating wonderful food, 

22
00:03:51,120 --> 00:04:02,000
from restaurant to restaurant, 
and drink, and all that.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,040
That's one type of vishaya-rasa.

24
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,920
The second type of vishaya-rasa 
goes into your feeling aspect.

25
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:28,320
Lots of imaginations, lot of mental 
distractions caused by karma—desire.

26
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,000
And the third type of 'rasa' is intellectual.

27
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:48,720
When you discover how bright you are—
how good you feel. Positively or negatively, 

28
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,005
whichever way,—that’s intellectual.

29
00:04:53,005 --> 00:05:01,120
‘Rasa’ in all the three stages,
if you are not a devotee of God, 

30
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,200
they are negative and they are like poison.

31
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,960
The only difference is poison kills you once, 

32
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,320
vishayaras will go on killing you—
There's no limit.

33
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,680
The proof is you are here. 

34
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:39,440
Imagine where have you been—
for the long time.

35
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:48,960
Every soul has gone through countless embodiments.
There was not a time when you didn't exist, 

36
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,400
but how did you exist?

37
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,880
I'm not leading you into too much of that. 

38
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:10,800
That also should not burden your mind.
Time is kind of a dream—it is not a reality.

39
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:28,960
So Vishayavyal, the snake of vishayaras—
vishayaras which I described in three stages— 

40
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,480
and that snake has bitten the soul.

41
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,040
It's all allegorical.

42
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:46,240
The main purpose of your life, real purpose,
is to remedy this poison, 

43
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:54,880
neutralize it before you end 
your present personality.

44
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:04,000
And for this type of mystic snake that 
has bitten you—for removing that poison— 

45
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:13,600
Rama mantra is powerful, potent remedy.

46
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,040
In other words, if you do 
japa with profound feeling, 

47
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,680
and surrender to God,
your mind will begin  

48
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:36,800
to develop taste for satsanga,
taste for developing virtuous qualities, 

49
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,800
taste for ascending the heights of wisdom—
and all that.

50
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:52,720
Once that change has occurred—
from vishayaras to bhaktiras, 

51
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:16,400
premaras, jnanaras, ras ras, rasovaisa—
that change is a real spiritual movement  

52
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
in an aspirant— 

53
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:30,000
shifting from lesser type of rasa to higher type—
until you go to the real rasa—raso vai saha.

54
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,680
“meṭata kathina kuaṁka bhāla ke.”
This also is a profound statement.

55
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:58,640
Rama mantra effaces—it’s a rubber that 
deletes what's written on your skull.

56
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,920
The village people really believe— 

57
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:16,960
they see a human skull and they 
find some strange scratches on it.

58
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,520
They say that's bhagya is written there—
what the person was, 

59
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,080
and what type of karmas he had done.
They are all given in a very  

60
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,840
subtle manner,
in a mystical language.

61
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,160
But turn away from that simile I gave, 

62
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:48,320
just to understand that 
everyone is moved by karma.

63
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,360
We are born with, led by 
prarabdha karma of the past.

64
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Just to give you again a 
rehashing of that subject.

65
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:11,600
Karma comes in three categories:
sanchita, prarabdha and kriyamana.

66
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,840
Kriyamana is also known as agami karma.

67
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:27,680
Sanchita is a total storehouse 
and it cannot be counted.

68
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:36,880
Out of sanchita karma, only a pinch or a group—
a small group—matures into prarabdha  

69
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,320
karma and that is the cause 
of your present embodiment.

70
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,080
Prarabdha karma determines 
for the soul three things: 

71
00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:00,240
Jati—what type of class of family 
the soul must incarnate into.

72
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,680
Everything is well-planned from the divine source.
You don't get a baby in your  

73
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,440
house just by accident.
But that is all a Divine plan.

74
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:21,040
And a baby inherits the good qualities, 

75
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,040
as well as defects, of the 
parents and the grandparents. 

76
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,520
That also is based on karma.
Nothing has come by chance.

77
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,200
Jati is determined, the class is determined,
by prarabdha.

78
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
Ayu is determined by prarabdha. 

79
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,680
Ayu is how long you are 
going to live in that body.

80
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,480
No matter what may be.
People may go on saying, 

81
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,520
“If only that medicine had been given, 
the person would have lived more.”

82
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,440
It seems reasonable and there is no harm in that.

83
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,920
But the reality is,
if prarabdha has ended, 

84
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:22,400
there is nothing in the 
world that can prevent death.

85
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,520
And everyone is conditioned by that.

86
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:38,160
If it is not your prarabdha to die,
you may fall from 20-stories high building , 

87
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:52,240
and fall into a truck that 
contains a lot of flowers.

88
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
But  

89
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:10,080
if prarabdha has ended,
even just one cup of tea—between  

90
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:25,360
the cup and the lip—
there occurs your end.

91
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,400
So jati, ayu and bhoga.

92
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:45,440
Another point, the general plot of your life—
how many days you will pass like spring, 

93
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,040
how many days you will pass like rains,
how many days you will pass like a storm, 

94
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,280
how many days you will pass like autumn.

95
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,360
I am giving you figurative language.

96
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,520
Just like seasons come, similarly, 

97
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:13,301
you have seasons of karmic process.
And nobody is exempt from it.

98
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:22,080
“Deha dhare kaa dand hai sab kahoo ko hoy.”
Whether you are Rama, Krishna, 

99
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,560
whether you are Jesus
—no matter who you are— 

100
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:37,520
and all sages and saints—Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,
Ramana Maharshi, Swami Sivananda— 

101
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:46,880
whomsoever,
the subject to disease, aging and death.

102
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,240
What I am describing is the bhoga,.
Bhoga refers to enjoyment. 

103
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,960
The term enjoyment is little confusing.

104
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:05,200
In philosophical language,
if certain karma has given you a lot of torture, 

105
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:18,360
in that language it is called,
“you are enjoying karma”—karma bhoga.

106
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,480
So no matter what you experience,
pleasure or pain, 

107
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,800
they are the fructification of karma.

108
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:44,480
So, led by karma, every soul goes on 
moving—from embodiment to embodiment.

109
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
That karma is as if written on the forehead. 

110
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,200
That karma—you are stamped 
with that karmic process.

111
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:03,360
Unstamp it, delete it.
How can you do that? 

112
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:13,200
Create a brush with the Divine name Rama.
And start applying it again and again.

113
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,560
I am using figurative language.

114
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,440
Turn to Ram Japa—
Divine name Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama.

115
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,120
Or complete mantra:Om Sri Ramayanama,
Om Sri Ramayanama. 

116
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,160
Or the mantra into which you are initiated.

117
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,400
All mantras are Rama mantra.

118
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:55,760
And that Rama mantra removes that what is written,
as it were, by your karmic process.

119
00:16:55,760 --> 00:17:03,840
And that aspect of creation is handled by Brahma,
the creator.

120
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,080
So whatever Brahma has written down on your lalat— 

121
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:28,320
your skull is called lalat—that will be effaced.
And let your lalat shine, being free of karmas.

122
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,520
In other words, the moment you have developed 
aspiration for attaining enlightenment, 

123
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,920
faith, and profound understanding, 

124
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:47,440
that the real you is not the body—
The real you is eternal Atma, the Self—

125
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,760
If that has started blossoming in your heart— 

126
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:03,273
that type of feeling—
you have cut down the karmic chain.

127
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:07,920
“harana moha tama dinakara kara se.” 

128
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:20,880
And for removing the darkness of moha—
moha is delusion, infatuation. 

129
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:28,560
But here it refers to ignorance 
itself—avidya, the source of moha.

130
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:37,920
Sometimes what's known as upalakshana, a word is 
used, but you don't take it exactly as the word, 

131
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,920
but where the word is pointing to.

132
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:49,440
The word moha has been used in this,
but it's pointing to avidya.

133
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,194
And for removing harana moha tama, 
moha is described as darkness.

134
00:18:56,194 --> 00:19:05,680
Dinakara—dinakara refers to the sun.
That's like the rays of the sun destroy darkness, 

135
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,880
Rama mantra destroys ignorance.

136
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:23,120
And for sustaining and nourishing devotees—
devotees are described like paddy field.

137
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,320
Rama mantra is like the cloud that gives rain. 

138
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,680
Just like a cloud comes, 
all the paddy field enjoys.

139
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:43,520
If you are in tune with japa and develop 
profound success in your practice sadhana,  

140
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,200
then that type of joy awaits you.

141
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:54,480
All that you do is simply sit down, relax,
let your mind recite the mantra, 

142
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,520
and allow your feeling to bring you to that state— 

143
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:08,640
that you are like in the paddy field.
And the mantra brings you nectary nourishment.

144
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,560
You can go one step further.

145
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,320
Imagine you are the peacock.
Rama mantra brings you rain, 

146
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:27,094
and you are spreading your feathers—
and the feathers are shining.

147
00:20:27,094 --> 00:20:36,215
abhimata dāni devataru bara se,
sevata sulabha sukhada hari hara se. 

148
00:20:36,215 --> 00:20:45,520
sukabi sarada nabha mana uḍaganase,
rāmabhagata jana jīvana dhana se.

149
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:57,200
The divine mantra is like kalpaka tree,
a mystic tree that gives you anything you wish.

150
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:08,320
All that you have to do is come close to the tree,
sit under the tree, and wish.

151
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,240
That's called kalpaka tree.

152
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:22,240
The real kalpaka tree allows your 
mind to be in tune with God's will. 

153
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:29,280
In one word, it is God realization.

154
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,360
But, God realization fulfills 
all your desires at once, 

155
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,280
and your entire mind itself is transcended.

156
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:52,160
While you are moving to God realization,
you go on experiencing increasing contentment— 

157
00:21:52,160 --> 00:22:02,000
real fulfillment of your wishes, your desires—
until all desires move away.

158
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:15,280
So Rama mantra is that type of kalpaka tree that 
will bestow upon you anything that you wish.

159
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Of course you must realize,
once you are repeating Rama mantra, 

160
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,320
you have no choice but to wish 
for that which is profound.

161
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,760
Because the very Rama mantra 
will change your intellect.

162
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,960
Without Rama mantra, 

163
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
your intellect goes after 
little things, petty things.

164
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,720
With Rama mantra,
your intellect develops  

165
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:50,560
sensitivity for higher things—
things of value, things of virtue.

166
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,480
Two things will happen:
Purity of your heart, 

167
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:02,720
that will allow you to have aspiration—
not ordinary desire; 

168
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,280
and fulfillment of that aspiration.

169
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,200
And they play the role of Rama mantra— 

170
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:20,720
the two aspects: Ra and Ma.
They are like Hari and Hara.

171
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:31,680
For a devotee, Rama mantra plays the 
role of Shiva and Vishnu put together.

172
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,276
That again is a profound implication.

173
00:23:34,276 --> 00:23:39,520
Alankara Priyo Vishnu, Abhisheka Priya Shiva.

174
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:48,400
If you are aVishnu devotee—that’s 
first to understand in a profound way.

175
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,160
In your spiritual movement, 

176
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:59,840
first stage of your progress 
is developing divine qualities— 

177
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,160
called daivi sampat:
Fearlessness, humility, 

178
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:14,240
charity, absence of vanity—
and all these great qualities.

179
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:23,600
The more you develop them,
the more you are invoking Lord Vishnu.

180
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,200
Lord Vishnu is pleased by ornaments.

181
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,240
These are the ornaments—Alankara Priyo.

182
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:38,080
You are developing them but it is like as if 
you are putting those ornaments on Lord Vishnu, 

183
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,600
because deep down you are Lord Vishnu—Divine.

184
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:53,440
So Vishnu's grace continues to 
deck you with divine qualities.

185
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,880
And that Lord Vishnu is called Hari.

186
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:12,480
Hari is figuratively—in a very profound way.
He plays the role of being a thief.

187
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,240
He enables you to develop profound feeling,
which is like butter.

188
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,360
You churn butter and He’s waiting.
Once the butter has been churned, 

189
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,960
your ego will not get it.

190
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,320
Your vishaya-vasana will not go after it. 

191
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:50,960
Krishna will come and steal it.
Hardly you will know who ate it.

192
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:57,600
What happened to all your sadhana?

193
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:06,880
There is a stealthy movement leading to a 
profound transformation in your personality— 

194
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,280
without your knowing.

195
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:13,520
You are simply doing your 
Integral Yoga day by day, 

196
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,640
and a deep down change goes on occurring—
stealthily.

197
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:27,680
Sometimes you are sleeping and you are getting 
more and more enriched in a spiritual way.

198
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:35,360
Lord Shiva's role is like a robber.

199
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,560
He doesn't steal—
he doesn't wait for you.

200
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,560
But when you have brought the climax,
you have developed— 

201
00:26:51,200 --> 00:27:02,160
you have removed mala, vikshepa,
and your ego has been practically effaced.

202
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:16,905
Now Shiva comes with his trishul,
and sucks up all your vasanas, all your ignorance.

203
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:19,600
What is being said is: 

204
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:30,960
Vishnu’s role is in the early stage of sadhana.
Shiva's role in the climax state of sadhana.

205
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,360
The same Vishnu is Shiva.
The same Shiva is Vishnu.

206
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:43,200
In the storyline,
they are devotees of each other.

207
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:54,160
So, when you serve Lord Rama,
or become devotee of Rama mantra,— 

208
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:00,480
then Rama mantra plays the role of Hari and Hara—
Vishnu and Shiva.

209
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,480
Rama mantra decks you with divine qualities, 

210
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:19,840
and Shiva brings in your mind absolute sannyasa—
and that's the goal of life.

211
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:32,640
Therefore, in Indian culture, even royalty—
when they had to fight against enemies— 

212
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,137
the army used to repeat “Haro Hara, Haro Hara.”

213
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:45,360
It's a figurative language.
Life is a battle.

214
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:57,840
In that battle, bring the slogan “Haro Hara,”
create divine virtues leading to absolute— 

215
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,760
nothing exists, nothing belongs to me.

216
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:15,083
If you have achieved that,
then you have attained real victory.

217
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:20,800
sakala sukṛta phala bhūri bhogase,
No—still there are some more points left.

218
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:34,945
The divine name Rama is like stars shining 
in the blue sky in the autumn season.

219
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:42,720
In Sharad Ritu when the sky is cloudless,
you see the stars shining.

220
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:52,640
Your mind… With Rama mantra, your mind becomes 
so purified that when you relax with your mind, 

221
00:29:52,640 --> 00:30:04,400
you are as if enjoying a starry sky—
twinkle twinkle little stars.

222
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,200
For the devotees of Rama,
Rama mantra is all their possessions, 

223
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,913
all their wealth.

224
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:21,535
sakala sukṛta phala bhūri bhogase,
jaga hita nirupadhi sādhu loga se. 

225
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:30,240
sevaka mana mānasa marāla se,
pāvana gaṁga taraṁga māla se.

226
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,320
Rama mantra brings about fructification of  

227
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,280
all your good karmas.
This allegorical term.

228
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:50,880
Any good karma has a limited fructification, 

229
00:30:50,880 --> 00:31:00,720
but Rama mantra creates such mystical 
type of good karma that the joy arising  

230
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:10,320
out of—the fructification arising out 
of that karma—is of a profound nature.

231
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:17,520
In simple terms, try to understand,
if you are rajasic, your joy will depend  

232
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:24,120
upon how many things have you attained,
how many things you have achieved.

233
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:34,480
If you are satvic, your joy is 
how closer you are coming to God, 

234
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:44,080
the joy of turning your mind into 
the sky with twinkling stars.

235
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:55,600
And Rama mantra is a benefactor,
like saints and sages, 

236
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
they are benefactors of the world.

237
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,720
Rama mantra is constant benefactor, 

238
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:16,000
because as you recite the Rama mantra,
and worship Rama and surrender to him, 

239
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:25,360
a total change begins to occur 
deep in your personality.

240
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:35,200
That Rama brings about a great transformation, 

241
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:46,480
and Rama mantra is like a swan in 
the mental lake of his devotees.

242
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,880
It’s allegorical.

243
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,200
If you look at a lake, and 
lake looks a little boring, 

244
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:06,400
but look at the swans swimming in the lake,
it brightens up.

245
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:18,560
The mind is like the lake Manasasovar,
and Rama mantra becomes like a swan.

246
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,880
It brings about a great transformation,
a great change in your mind. 

247
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,720
Or the mind enjoys Rama mantra in a profound way.

248
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,560
And among purifiers, 

249
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:41,206
Rama mantra is like taranga malas of Ganga
—the waves of Ganges river.

250
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:47,774
kupatha kutaraka kucāli 
kali kapaṭa daṁbha pāṣaṁda, 

251
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:54,880
dahana rāma guna grāma jimi 
iṁdhana anala pracaṁḍa. 32(A).

252
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:06,640
Rama mantra is the bestower of all divine virtues—
the entire daivi sampat— 

253
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:16,813
and remover of negative qualities,
which are known as asuri sampat.

254
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:25,600
Kumarga—asuri qualities are 
described moving on a wrong path.

255
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,760
One path is satsanga. another 
is opposed to satsanga—kusanga.

256
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:43,400
The path leading to kusanga is kumarga.
The path leading to satsanga is sanamarga.

257
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:51,840
Kutaraka— wrong type of reasoning.
This is called asuri sampat.

258
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,400
The example of kutaraka— 

259
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:07,280
a tiger was drinking water from 
a river—from a mountain river. 

260
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:17,360
Unwittingly, without thinking,
a deer comes without knowing that  

261
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:22,880
tiger was nearby,
started drinking.

262
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:38,240
And the tiger, whose mind has become activated 
by seeing the deer, says to the deer, 

263
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:49,680
"How dare you let me drink the water 
that you have sipped,—juta water?"

264
00:35:49,680 --> 00:36:04,080
The deer said, "Oh Sir, the water is coming from 
you to me, so I am not giving you juta water."

265
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,240
Then he said, "Oh, forget about it. 

266
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:15,920
But why did your father say 
abusive words towards me?"

267
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,240
The deer had no answer.

268
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,800
So this is called kutaraka. 

269
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:34,080
You create your own rationality to achieve 
what you want to achieve egoistically, 

270
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,040
and there is no real reasoning behind it.

271
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,160
This is called brute logic.

272
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,901
These are demoniac qualities—
kupatha—wrong path, 

273
00:36:52,901 --> 00:37:00,320
kutaraka—wrong logic,
kuchal—wrong conduct, 

274
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:10,480
and kapata—deceptive movement.

275
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,680
And I will not deal with it 
because everybody knows it. 

276
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:25,125
You know the enemies can pretend to be so loving,
but all their love and all their words are wicked— 

277
00:37:25,125 --> 00:37:37,267
kapat yukt, deceptive
and pakhanda, hypocrisy.

278
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,409
Asuri sampat:

279
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:46,379
dambho darpo ’bhimānaśh cha 
krodhaḥ pāruṣhyam eva cha 

280
00:37:46,602 --> 00:37:52,632
ajñānaṁ chābhijātasya pārtha sampadam āsurīm

281
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:01,440
In the Gita in the 16th chapter,
you have the description of daivi sampat 

282
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,653
and asuri sampat.

283
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:15,950
The asuri sampat has been described.
Dambho—deceptive, darpo—conceit, 

284
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:30,720
abhiman—egotistic, krodha—anger,
parushyam—speaking very harsh, bitter words.

285
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,000
They all arise out of ajnana because 
they are never going to do good to you, 

286
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,040
but your ignorance doesn't 
allow you to understand.

287
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:57,360
Daivi sampat, contrasted from asuri sampat:
abhayam—fearlessness. All this I am saying quickly  

288
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:08,080
and they are to be attained by sustained effort—
no matter how long it takes.

289
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,040
And your success is never absolute,
there is always degrees of success, 

290
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,800
but an effort directed in the right direction—no  

291
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,080
matter how little progress 
you make—is substantial.

292
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:34,560
How to stay fearless—
that you have to work upon it.

293
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:42,160
The main answer is:
if you keep yourself involved under good guidance, 

294
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:49,440
practice integral yoga in your daily life,
abhayam—fearlessness—will  

295
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,800
enter your heart by degrees,
until the fearlessness becomes enormous.

296
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:06,480
And if that happens,
you are enlightened, you are liberated.

297
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,760
Steadiness in Jnana and Yoga.
Steadiness in practicing  

298
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,360
vichar—that’s what is meant by jnana.
Vichar means affirmation—“Who am I? I  

299
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,040
am not the body, I am not the 
mind, I am not the intellect, 

300
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:30,080
I am Satchidananda— existence, 
knowledge, bliss, absolute”.

301
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:38,480
And Yoga. The term Yoga in this 
context is meditation—directing  

302
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,720
your mind to the practice of 
concentration, meditation.

303
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:54,480
Also, another term is used, upasana, 
directing your mind to love of God.

304
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:03,360
Danam—developing the quality of being charitable, 

305
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,240
a charitable personality.
\You should be like a sandalwood tree.

306
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Not only you are charitable to 
people who come praising you,  

307
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,160
but you are charitable even to 
people who come to cut you down.

308
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,920
Don't take it too literally.

309
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:36,240
But the idea—that’s where goodness 
reaches a divine stage—a goodness that  

310
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,784
brings the head off the most terrible 
personalities—brings the head down.

311
00:41:53,779 --> 00:42:03,520
And the victory that you attain by goodness—
that victory is yours and it is perfect.

312
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:08,320
But any victory attained by deceptive method— 

313
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:15,760
by cruelty and so forth—
that victory is extremely… 

314
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:25,068
it's just like you created a wonderful 
pudding but pushed in some worms.

315
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,480
All these negative qualities that I described—
they’re called asuri sampat— 

316
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:51,296
they are destroyed by Rama nama,
just like fuel is burnt down by fire.

317
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:57,150
rāmacarita rākesa kara sarisa sukhada saba kāhu,  

318
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:04,168
sajjana kumuda cakora cita 
hita biseṣi bara lāhu. 32(B).

319
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:18,160
The glorious story of Rama—Ramacharitra—
all the conduct of Rama, all his righteous deeds, 

320
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,760
all the story of Rama is known as Ramacharitra.

321
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:34,320
Ramacharitra is like the purnima—full moon—
showering nectarine rays on all.

322
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:44,720
Sarve bhavantu sukinah—May all be happy,
that type of divine will emanates from  

323
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,360
Ramacharitra.

324
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,560
Those who are sajjans,
those who are already devotees, 

325
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:03,760
who enjoy satsanga,
they are like lotuses—closed lotuses.

326
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,680
Ramacharitra makes the lotus blossom.

327
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,200
Or they are like chakora birds— 

328
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:21,040
again and again Indian literature is filled 
with a type of bird that stays on a tree, 

329
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,880
and becomes so fascinated by the 
moon, that it goes into ecstasy.

330
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,720
Ram mantra and Ramcharitmanas—the 
Ramcharitra, that's what happens  

331
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:52,591
to your chit—the heart within you,
that becomes like chakor, it enters to ecstasy.

332
00:44:52,591 --> 00:45:00,293
kīnhi prasna jehi bhiti bhavānī,
jehi bidhi samkara kahā bakhānī. 

333
00:45:00,293 --> 00:45:07,617
so saba hetu kahaba mat gāī,
kathāprabaṁdha bicitra banāī.

334
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:15,280
The manner in which Parvati Devi asked questions— 

335
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:24,960
asked of Shiva—that story is coming, 
very engrossing and very profound.

336
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:33,920
And Lord Shiva narrated this story extensively.

337
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,611
And all that story I am going to 
relate to you through this Ramayana.

338
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:48,750
jeht yaha kathā sunī nahi hoī,
jani ācaraju karai suni soī. 

339
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:57,116
kathā alaukika sunahi je gyānī,
naht ācaraju karahi asa jānī.

340
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:07,040
Now, Tulsidasji is also 
pointing out to the fact that, 

341
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:14,480
when you read the Ramayana,
many passages or many of the stories, 

342
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,160
don't agree with Valmiki Ramayana.

343
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:29,600
Valmiki Ramayana has done the 
same thing in a different way.

344
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:36,240
And some stories are totally 
different from Valmiki Ramayana.

345
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,520
The fact is, Ramayana writing 
is not a historical writing.

346
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,280
It's an allegorical mystic writing.

347
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:56,160
Mystic writing is done by sages according 
to the need of the people they face.

348
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,120
So those subtle details we will describe later.

349
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:12,400
But at this stage, Valmiki's Ramayana is more 
focused on non-dual Vedanta, JnanaPradhan.

350
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,760
Tulsi Ramayana is Bhakti Pradhan—
more focused on devotion.

351
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,080
Valmiki Ramayana ends up with Rama being alone.

352
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:38,960
Even Sita—Rama worked so hard for attaining Sita—
Even that Sita goes away from Rama—ultimately.

353
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:52,320
Tulsi Ramayana doesn't handle that,
but simply says—Rama and Sita enjoy forever.

354
00:47:52,320 --> 00:48:01,120
So if you are too foxy in your mind, 

355
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,840
you'll go on asking “Which is better, 
Tulsi Ramayana or Valmiki Ramayana?”

356
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:18,240
If you happen to read other Ramayanas, they tell 
the story in another way,—a totally different way.

357
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,400
Many engrossing stories are 
there in other Ramayanas, 

358
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,640
which Tulsi Ramayana doesn't have.

359
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:40,720
And Tulsidasji says “Do not wonder about it.”—
If you read this Ramayana and it doesn't  

360
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,989
tally with your concept of what you 
have read, don't wonder about it.

361
00:48:47,989 --> 00:49:00,480
kathā alaukika sunahi je gyānī—those who 
are wise, they hear stories that are alokik.

362
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:07,520
Alokik implies something totally new. 

363
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,400
And they do not wonder 
about those stories because—

364
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:23,280
In other words, for enlightened mind,
the same katha—the same story of Rama— 

365
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,800
no two enlightened persons will say the story 
exactly the same ,because each enlightened  

366
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:39,840
one looks at his audience and reaches out 
to the audience according to their need.

367
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:51,120
And in doing so, he has absolute freedom.
He can make Rama cross a river— 

368
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:58,800
even in Balakanda, where he is 
going to Ayodhya to marry Sita.

369
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:07,520
Valmiki has allowed Rama to cross a 
river and all the joy of devotees.

370
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:14,400
Tulsidasji makes him wait.
He crosses when he is in the forest.

371
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,464
All these are minor and major changes.

372
00:50:26,405 --> 00:50:34,327
rāmakathā kai miti jaga nāhī,
asi pratīti tinha ke mana māhī. 

373
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:41,995
nānā bhāti rāma avatārā,
rāmāyana sata koṭi apārā.

374
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:47,344
rāmakathā kai miti jaga nāhī— 

375
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:54,931
There is no count of how many 
variations of Ramakatha exist.

376
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:08,080
Without my going into details,
a direct understanding—all souls are Rama— 

377
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:18,400
and each soul, what you have gone through,
what awaits you in future is Ramakatha.

378
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:28,560
Count Ramakathas—how many are there?
Miti jaga nāhī. There is no count.

379
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:37,532
Once you understand Ramakatha in that sense,
you are moving towards wisdom.

380
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:47,040
Nānā bhāti rāma avatārā—
Rama as avatara appeared  

381
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,095
in the world in countless manners.

382
00:51:52,298 --> 00:52:02,938
Rāmāyana sata koṭi apārā.
Shata koṭi—koti is more than a million.

383
00:52:03,766 --> 00:52:11,120
Mathematically, probably it is 10 million or so.

384
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,480
But forget about mathematics.
Shata koti—millions and millions types. 

385
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:26,189
Million by million type.
So many are Ramayanas. 

386
00:52:26,189 --> 00:52:28,559
Which Ramayana you want to read?

387
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:39,569
Every soul is Rama, and all that is experienced 
by the soul from bondage to release is Ramayana.

388
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:44,298
And with this I will conclude.

389
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:51,332
Om Shri Ramayana, Om Namah Shivaya.
Om Shanti, Shanti, Shanti.
