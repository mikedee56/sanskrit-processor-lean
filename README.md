- Required packages: `pandas`, `pysrt`, `fuzzywuzzy`, `python-Levenshtein`, `pyyaml`

### Installation

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This project uses a pre-configured virtual environment**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/post-processing-shruti.git
cd post-processing-shruti

# Activate the pre-configured virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

# Verify installation
python -c "import fuzzywuzzy, sanskrit_parser, pysrt; print('✅ Environment ready')"
```

**If virtual environment is missing or corrupted:**
```bash
# Create new virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# OR
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

# Install all dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.post_processors.sanskrit_post_processor import SanskritPostProcessor

# Initialize the processor
processor = SanskritPostProcessor()

# Process an SRT file
input_file = "data/raw_srts/lecture.srt"
output_file = "data/processed_srts/lecture_processed.srt"

metrics = processor.process_srt_file(input_file, output_file)
print(f"Processed {metrics.total_segments} segments with {metrics.segments_modified} modifications")
```
