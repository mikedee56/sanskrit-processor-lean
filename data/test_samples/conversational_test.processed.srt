Today we will discuss, explore the Bhagavad Gita chapter 2 verse 25.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
This verse, this verse talks about the eternal nature of the soul.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
That, the soul is described as imperishable and eternal.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Kṛṣṇa explains, he reveals the true nature of the ātman in this teaching.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
The soul cannot be cut by weapons, and it cannot be burned by fire.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
What t was, the soul is beyond physical destruction

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
This is a fundamental teaching, so we must understand its significance.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, this concept appears in verse 27 as if I recall correctly.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
The ancient sages understood this truth, and they passed it down through generations.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
What this means, is that consciousness is eternal and unchanging.
