00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Um, today we will discuss, uh, I mean we'll explore the Bhagavad Gita chapter two verse twenty five.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,000
This verse, you know, actually this verse talks about the eternal nature of the soul.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,000
Let me rephrase that, the soul is described as imperishable and eternal.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Krishna explains, rather, he reveals the true nature of the atman in this teaching.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
The the soul cannot be cut by weapons, and and it cannot be burned by fire.

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,000
What I meant was, the soul is beyond physical destruction entirely.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
Now, this is a fundamental teaching, so we must understand its significance.

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, this concept appears in verse twenty seven as well, um, if I recall correctly.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,000
The ancient sages understood this truth, and and they passed it down through generations.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,000
So, what this means, you see, is that consciousness is eternal and unchanging.
