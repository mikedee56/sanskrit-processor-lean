00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,800
Adorations to Lord Kṛṣṇa; the Preceptor of the Universe;

3
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:14,640
Destroyer of the forces of Darkness and bestower of immortality;

4
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Śrīmad Bhagavad Gītā in chapter 3 verse number 30. This chapter is

5
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:34,320
known as karma yoga. Yoga of action. Always remember you have four yogas. Karma yoga,

6
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,400
yoga of action. Yoga relating to your feelings called yoga for devotion. Bhakti

7
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:55,360
yoga. yoga relating to the willing movement of the mind. Dhyāna yoga. Yoga of meditation

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:07,760
and yoga that relates to your intellect, reasoning, understanding that's called jñāna yoga

9
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,040
to figure out which yoga you want to practice.

10
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:21,600
Can practice any one of the four, but always understand that all the four are always together.

11
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,120
Just like in your personality, you can highlight your hand,

12
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:39,840
you can highlight your heart, highlight your neck, highlight your head.

13
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,680
Whichever you may highlight, all the others follow it.

14
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:59,840
So this make it simple. This is called sura yoga or integral yoga. So with that

15
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:11,600
broad understanding of integral yoga, focus your attention on karma action

16
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:20,800
first to understand what we mean by action. Whatever you do by your thoughts that the

17
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:33,760
basis of your karma action. Action has three forms. Thought word lead

18
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,760
to a broader understanding.

19
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,120
No one can live without karma even for a single second.

20
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,160
Even when you say I'm not doing going to do any

21
00:03:48,160 --> 00:04:00,240
work that the time you are doing more work than you ever imagined.

22
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,080
Therefore all these points have been made clear before.

23
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,840
Now the question arises always before a person

24
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,600
to understand the difference between svadharma and paradharma.

25
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:33,920
Swadharma is that which is in harmony with your personality and with your spiritual evolution

26
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,360
and you are born with it.

27
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:51,200
For example, led by your karmic process. You come into a family, you have father, mother.

28
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,960
Once you look at your father and mother,

29
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:03,520
now you don't have any choice. I should have another set of

30
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,680
starts.

31
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,040
That doesn't mean that you you disrespect other parents,

32
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:30,160
but your practical life depends upon your parents. In the same way you come with

33
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:40,560
certain karmic tendencies because your actions have not started just in this life. KMAS have

34
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:52,000
gone on through many lives. No two children in a family have the same karma. Ask the mothers.

35
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,960
One may be may have that inclination for arts. Another may have inclination

36
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:20,720
for mathematics and one may be a genius etc. So similarly every soul has come with

37
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:35,600
karma. Karma in a broad sense is of three types. Sañcita karma which

38
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:46,320
means accumulated storehouse of karma that karma exists in your causal plane.

39
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:57,600
It's it's an abstract. It's a very advanced technology.

40
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Kas from millions of lives have accumulated and they are all recorded there. But they don't impact

41
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:18,480
on you at all. You don't know it. But out of all those sitas, a portion, just a little pinch,

42
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,800
has been the cause of your present embodiment. That pinch of karma that

43
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:39,520
has created your present embodiment is called prārabdha fructifying karma. Fructifying karma

44
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:55,120
determines plans out three things. Jati Aayua. Jati means in what family will you be born?

45
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:06,880
Your personality must match up with a family where there will be right type of influence.

46
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:15,360
If you are a musician, you be drawn to a family or even be before you open your eyes. In other words,

47
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,920
when open your eyes, you see musical instruments around you. Maybe a flute,

48
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,480
maybe a something else, piano or whatever. Even prior to that, even before you open your eyes,

49
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:40,240
you are listening to music. Father has been playing piano or whatever. So the idea is that

50
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:49,600
you are drawn to a family because of your praabda. Next point,

51
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,920
what type of body will you have and how long will you live?

52
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,200
That also is

53
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:13,040
well planned in a divine way. That's called au how long you are going to live and boa boa

54
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:23,520
means pleasure and pain experiences of joy and sorrow prosperity and adversity and in every

55
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:33,200
life you have experience of joy and sorrow. No one's life is just all happiness just like

56
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,640
You experience day and night.

57
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:49,520
It is not just perpetual day unless you are in po

58
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,000
and you enjoy to have day and night. Similarly, joy and sorrow.

59
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,880
The quantity and the quality of those vogas they depend upon your kmas.

60
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,440
While this has been already planned,

61
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:22,880
sketched out in your as you live your life you improve upon the basic sketch.

62
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:31,680
Just like a painter has wants to bring out some art, piece of art,

63
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:42,400
he himself doesn't know what it will look like in the end. So he starts putting some lines. Outlines

64
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:52,800
praabdai is the outline just a little sketch. Your effort what you do now in this life you

65
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,080
are building upon the basis of that sketch and you have the possibility to make the

66
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:13,440
sketch turn into divine. No matter how it was in the basic stage or make it demonic your

67
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:30,160
purusha your self effort can bring out divine in you. You can blossom or you can stay thorn.

68
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:38,320
The goal before you is no matter whatever prārabdha you may have

69
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,600
allow your mind to become involved in satsanga

70
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:54,000
be inspired to follow spiritual path and develop a deep understanding that you can

71
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,680
you are not dependent on kmas so don't go after asking astrologers what type of karma I had in

72
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:12,400
the past. No matter whatever kmas you have the possibility of turning those karmas. If

73
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:22,800
suppose you have lot of adversity try to bring a spirit of austerity while facing adversity count

74
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:32,480
upon your faith. Develop strength of faith. Get involved with satsanga etc. So ultimately your

75
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:44,400
adversity that was based on a negative karma now has led you to develop spiritual association. It

76
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:53,200
has led you to gain deeper insight into the goal of life. It has speeded your spiritual movement.

77
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,320
So it doesn't matter what whatever might have been the cause that created your

78
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:09,760
negative karma but you have the ability to turn it turn into it into your favor.

79
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:21,280
Likewise suppose some good karmas of the past has brought you lot of prosperity unimaginable

80
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,640
not a single day of rest always something drawing you to wonderful

81
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:37,520
things come to waterfalls come to the Himalayas lots of invitations

82
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,400
I'm just making up joke but idea what that's

83
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:48,960
bad. The prosperity keeps your mind moving around this fact.

84
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:59,280
Why? Because you did good kas.

85
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:08,480
You can utilize your prosperity and become more prosperous, more more enriched in a spiritual

86
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:18,000
way. And most people during prosperity, they become vain. And after that good karma

87
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:27,840
of the past is over, they have they find themselves tumbling into a lesser plane.

88
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:36,480
So their good karma of the past has proven negative

89
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,760
all that again is allegorical what I'm saying

90
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,400
I'm not condoning negative kmas but no matter whatever your karmas might have

91
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:58,080
been in the past you are the architect of your destiny that point is being hammered on you And

92
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:10,400
therefore do not let your mind become just in a state of despair but rather hold on to that

93
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,680
inner in inspiration that you have the potential to to change your karma and

94
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,760
your goal is to attain self-reization. So while I was talking about sit karma

95
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:34,960
accumulated storehouse a pinch of it gave you prārabdha prārabdha you

96
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:43,360
modify develop on that prārabdha by your self effort the new kmas

97
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,600
that are generated now on the basis of your praabda they are called karma current karma

98
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:01,200
Current karma goes in two directions. One aspect of current karma may join

99
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:08,480
your parabdha and bear fruit within this lifetime.

100
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,400
Another aspect certain karma you do and you don't get the result in

101
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:23,360
this life. Why? Because there are many karmas lined up in a queue.

102
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:32,080
So every kva doesn't have the opportunity to get the result. Many of your good kmas

103
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:40,400
line up you did meditation today lot of japa the result of that karma should be

104
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,680
should give you happiness doesn't come today comes five days later.

105
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:06,320
I'm trying to give in a simple way to understand

106
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:15,440
embellishing your praabda and creating a basis for future embodiment.

107
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:27,520
But if you have started practicing karma yoga now you are

108
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:36,320
moving towards karma yoga means by performing your actions

109
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:47,200
you're purifying your heart. action karma for chittashudi purity of heart. As heart is purified,

110
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,040
devotion begins to develop. You are not your love is directed towards God,

111
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:07,440
not towards your ego. Your ego becomes inferior. God becomes the highlight.

112
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:19,440
Meditation begins to develop and deep insight begins to develop insight into who am I.

113
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:29,280
All this implies that you are once karma has turned to karma yoga you

114
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,920
are moving towards enlightenment liberation.

115
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:45,520
If you attain liberation, liberation is attain attained during your lifetime. Your goal is not

116
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:56,080
to keep it in future but always the goal is to become enlightened. Becoming enlightened again has

117
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:07,040
has two implications. Suppose you are climbing a mountain. You have to go to the top. In the early

118
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:17,120
state of your movement, your climbing process is defective. You climb and then you fall down. Go up

119
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:29,600
and down and up and down and sometimes you break your legs. So it takes time to again go on to fly.

120
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,520
Next stage comes

121
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,880
you go on climbing but there are down downfalls

122
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:47,680
and and when you get into the trap of downfall it will delay you etc.

123
00:19:48,560 --> 00:20:00,480
Third type you have come to you become so skilled that falling back is impossible. Moving up that's

124
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:10,800
the only one way left. The moment you have come to that state you are called enlightened.

125
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,320
No matter where you are because we have only one way to go.

126
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:27,680
So you go on moving towards like a river that has come close to the ocean and has up on a

127
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:36,720
mountain looking down into the ocean. Nose is already moving towards now for the river

128
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:45,360
to enter the ocean. It has no other choice but to dissolve in ocean. It is enlightened.

129
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,880
Similarly, you become when you become enlightened.

130
00:20:52,880 --> 00:21:03,600
All kmas are burnt up. All sit karmmas that could have given you millions and trillions

131
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:11,440
of embodiment and still they will not be exhausted because you go on adding karmas.

132
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:29,120
But entire karma storehouse burns upd

133
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,480
mystical way. If it got burnt up literally your body will suddenly vanish the moment

134
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:53,360
you attain liberation. People will be extremely afraid of

135
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,000
You hear the news, they came to the

136
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,760
vanished

137
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:19,120
and the a newspaper says they all attain liberation.

138
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:39,360
Liberation is not vanishing of the physical body.

139
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Inwardly you are not the body. Your body has become your cell phone.

140
00:22:51,040 --> 00:23:01,040
You are not confined to the body. You just like a wave. Wave remains a wave and yet it can have

141
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:08,480
the attunement I am the ocean. Once you have reached that that's that's called liberation.

142
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,920
All these scriptures have been given by liberated sages. If they

143
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:30,080
were liberated and vanished, there will be no scriptures.

144
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,720
Having surrendered all actions to me with your mind illumined by spiritual vision,

145
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:54,320
you should fight without desire free from the sense of mindness and the de and devoid

146
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:04,720
of the fever of mental worries. No, this is highly condensed writing.

147
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,880
Having surrendered all actions to me.

148
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,720
How to attain enlightenment. Certain points have been already discussed before. Understand

149
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,760
the importance of sadharma. Actions that have come to you by your very nature.

150
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:42,080
If you have you are inclined to mathematics get ahead. If you are inclined to artistic

151
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:51,280
painting etc or music etc then move ahead in that direction. That's I'm speaking broadly

152
00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:00,400
from another point of view. No matter whatever type of duty you are doing in divine plan,

153
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,960
everyone is placed in certain situations, circumstances where where you whether you

154
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,840
like it or not, you have to go do certain things and certain chores of life. When you do that,

155
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:28,480
don't do it with a sense of disgust. cursing yourself and your fate but do it with a sense

156
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:37,920
that it is divinely planned situation. How fortunate am I because God is going to make

157
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:46,720
me do it even though I don't find all the strength behind but God is there with that

158
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:57,200
faith and trust and with a sense of respect towards whatever duty you do not disgust.

159
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:11,760
Just like whatever food you eat, if you eat it with disgust, it's going to create digestion.

160
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:20,880
If you face your karma with disgust, it's going to create negative situations.

161
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,920
So that subtle point has to be understood. But now

162
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,400
raise the level of understanding.

163
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Doing your duties.

164
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,600
A profounder

165
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,400
purpose behind it is to develop

166
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:58,240
that understanding that God is working through me. Who am I? It's not ego that accomplishes anything.

167
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:16,160
Even just digesting food, ego can't do it.

168
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:30,800
that the profound goal has to be in view. Go on building up that sense that God is working through

169
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:42,000
me. I am an instrument in divine hand and every action I am doing is a form of worship of God.

170
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,680
It is to please God. You are doing the action not to please the ego.

171
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:57,360
Ego is a monkey when it is pleased. The monkey that rides on your neck

172
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,880
when it is pleased it chokes your neck displeased.

173
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:14,240
It chokes it also both ways cuz both ways legs around your death.

174
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:22,160
So having surrendered so actions to be done with a spirit of surrender to God. That's a

175
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:38,880
broad understanding of karma yoga with your mind illumined by spiritual vision. Another

176
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,560
term is used.

177
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:50,480
Whatever work you do, do it with vaudi with a

178
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:59,040
with a discriminative with a mind that knows the difference between

179
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:11,520
right and wrong. Between good and just that which seems pleasant but not good. Between and prayer.

180
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,360
Sha that which uplifts you. Prayer that remains pleasant but degrades you. The mind that knows

181
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:29,040
that type of difference. That type of mind you must develop while you are doing your duties.

182
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:38,480
And you develop it. If you are practicing daily sadhana like japa, meditation,

183
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,760
satsanga, as you go on doing that, automatically

184
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,720
your movement in daily life, your conduct in daily life is

185
00:29:50,720 --> 00:30:01,360
guided by discerning intellect. No matter what situation you are,

186
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:05,840
you will not outstep

187
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,200
the limits of righteousness.

188
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,280
In other words, no matter whatever situation you are,

189
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,800
you will not do something for which you may have to regret.

190
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:31,040
This is again ideal. Ideal means you go on failing, you go on making mistakes,

191
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:40,000
but don't pat on your back how wonderful you are.

192
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:49,600
Always understand mistakes are mistakes and not to regret about the mistakes too much only you

193
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:58,320
should move ahead. So many mistakes you have overcome and this you are going to overcome.

194
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:08,400
That's called first point using vaudi in your life. So that recognize what error did you

195
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:19,760
commit which you should not commit again? What lessons have you learned which you should use?

196
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:33,600
And therefore day by day you are learning improving moving towards God

197
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:43,040
and all actions to be offered to God. That point I have already explained.

198
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,320
Third point

199
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,960
means without expectations

200
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
in common

201
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:07,360
parlance when the people talk together. The word nasha is pathetic word. Asha

202
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,000
expectation. Nasha being expectationless.

203
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,640
It brings sadness in the heart.

204
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:33,520
But your goal is to become nash. All ashas, all expectations must move away. As long as

205
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:44,480
there are not perfect. A river flows on there is expectation enters the ocean

206
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:54,480
full. All that you expect in the past, present and future all is fulfilled.

207
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,160
Then you are nasha

208
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:04,000
dev of all expectations and desires.

209
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,520
That should be your goal.

210
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,600
the sense of me and mine. Therefore,

211
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:22,080
mantras always have that. The subtle implication is nothing

212
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:30,800
neither mean nor mine

213
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,040
and you should fight. People understand the term

214
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:55,360
Luchand you will ask poor person how is life and the Spanish language says

215
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:13,280
The term fight it doesn't mean real fight. The entire story of

216
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,240
life moving towards God. Realization. Fight is

217
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:33,360
between the higher forces of light and forces of darkness.

218
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:44,160
compassion, understanding, humility. They come with divine appearance,

219
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:57,360
divine garbs and chant they go and fight.

220
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:09,520
Allow that fight to go on day by day. Then your life is wonderful. Then you are living

221
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,600
goes on telling

222
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:30,320
fight but not with fever. Fever of the body or fever of the mind.

223
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Not with mental stress. The term Sanskrit terms are shoka and moa. Not with grief or delusion.

224
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:57,600
Then your fight will be a movement of spiritual progress. It will a form of festivity.

225
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,840
It will not be

226
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:11,520
degrading, humiliating. You will not be defeated. Is a fight that

227
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:22,880
is actually a celebration of your coming victory.

228
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:31,280
Those

229
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:39,120
who are endowed with faith and are free from the voice of finding fault with my

230
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:52,560
teachings. They too attain freedom from all actions by following the path revealed by me.

231
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,960
Now two points are there. People listen to

232
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:08,240
certain teachings intellectually they grasp they can repeat the teachings

233
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:16,560
but in practice they won't do it.

234
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:21,280
Then there are others they may not repeat all that

235
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:33,440
but they have their heart has felt the joy of listening and faith has entered.

236
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:43,840
So therefore a person of faith may not have listened all but whatever the fa person of

237
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:52,480
faith listens to is effective. It's going to be digested. It will bring you spiritual

238
00:37:52,480 --> 00:38:02,560
nourishment. So therefore it doesn't matter if you have not understood all these teachings.

239
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,120
or you don't possess the knowledge that the intellectuals possess. Don't compare with

240
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:21,040
them. Move by faith. Faith gives you a greater guarantee for your spiritual movement than your

241
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:30,080
rational intellectual understanding. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't have understanding.

242
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:39,440
You have to understand the difference between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge.

243
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:48,560
There is saying an house of practice is better than tons of theory.

244
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:54,400
When you have faith in what you have heard that allows you to practice,

245
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:02,480
you may be practicing only an ounce. Another person has accumulated tons

246
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:12,160
of theory but there isn't a house of practice who is better the one who has

247
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:22,640
faith based movement that's what Kṛṣṇa is saying those who are endowed with faith

248
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,600
and free from the voice of finding fault with my teachings

249
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:46,880
You may not have all the teaching but don't find fault with it.

250
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,240
And having mentioned one vice you are actually called upakana is pointing

251
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:02,080
out the group of vices all that is called mala kama crodha loha moa

252
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:12,960
mada matsara all that is implied if you have the malas gross impurities

253
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
faith within you cannot be active

254
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:24,560
So your faith must

255
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,080
have a fashion

256
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:35,200
must be equipped with these gonas. These divine qualities,

257
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:54,000
qualities of absence of anger, humility, gentleness, sincerity, all good virtues.

258
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:08,640
But those who do not follow my teachings and are afflicted with the voice of finding fault

259
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:16,560
blow them to be dullwitted and deluded in every form of knowledge. They are

260
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,800
heading towards their own destruction. Those who do not follow my teachings,

261
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:34,080
what is my teachings? Perform all actions with the spirit of surrender to God.

262
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:45,280
That's the central per central essence of the teachings.

263
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,480
All your duties with shadi.

264
00:41:52,480 --> 00:42:07,200
Your heart must have faith that you are worshiping God through your duties and God is going to

265
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,880
respond to you because your relationship with God is like a child's relationship

266
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,280
with a mother and a child has tremendous faith.

267
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:30,560
may figure that out.

268
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,560
That type of relationship must develop

269
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,320
and

270
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:48,880
mind that that develops always a sense of contradiction, a sense of jealousy.

271
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,200
sense of opposition.

272
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:07,360
Instead of that develop mind that trusts faith

273
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:16,320
is characterized byia is called jealousy. Matsara.

274
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:23,200
Matsar term is not only you are jealous but your mind is buzzing

275
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:33,840
with lots of defects in people like so many mosquitoes buzz over you

276
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:42,560
and you don't find rest. You go to a wonderful picturesque setting of nature, wonderful lake.

277
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:55,840
Everywhere is something so delightful. But suddenly a swarm of mosquitoes very small little

278
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:09,280
they're called maturk

279
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:16,160
word mats

280
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,400
certain negative way of thinking that goes on buzzing over you

281
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:36,480
in such a way all the beauty and glory and grace of God goes away

282
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,120
and the world becomes joyous for it. People are wonderful. The world is

283
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:52,240
joyous. The breeze blows with divine grace. Sun shines with joy. The ocean surges with

284
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:59,360
joy. And all is beckoning your soul to its highest attainment. They all

285
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:10,400
welcoming you. They live for you. They are working for you. They exist for you.

286
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,760
But if that ishavi then you are moving that way.

287
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:31,280
Then your thoughts are constantly creating perverted desires, anger, sama, croha,

288
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:46,800
loha, greed, moa, delusion, man, pride, matsaria. this mosquito type of jealous.

289
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:55,200
So if you have that sodha and are moving away from this matsara, you are going to

290
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:04,960
attain the goal. But those who don't have it, they are heading towards their own destruction.

291
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,200
What do we mean by destruction?

292
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:17,040
The term destruction is used in a figurative way. Soul cannot be destroyed. That's

293
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:28,640
figurative way. It is used that your self effort becomes as if dead. If you are not aware of your

294
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,640
self effort, you are unable to exercise your self effort, then you are living in vain.

295
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,880
You will again come back to it. But nature will have to take lot

296
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:53,440
of time to bring you back into that situation. You go through many lives

297
00:46:53,440 --> 00:47:01,360
conditioning the object.

298
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:10,800
It means your your mind is hugging the object. It's a mental

299
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:20,960
mental phenomenon sa

300
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:32,240
if attachment has developed in your mind. Now the mind is restless unless it gets the object

301
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:41,440
and it is an impossible task. Object is not a reality point of view and object has not been

302
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:57,040
the source of your happiness. So you is a wrong pursuit. But nevertheless follow the story.

303
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:06,320
This mental dependence, mental attachment causes desires. Mind is restless. So it has

304
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:12,960
to have so many desires to fulfill it to cure the restlessness. But running after

305
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:25,040
desires and fulfilling them doesn't really cure. It enhances the rest.

306
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,000
While you are trying to fulfill your desires,

307
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:41,360
two possibilities are there. Things oppose the fulfillment. Then you become angry, agitated

308
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:54,080
and another your desires are fulfilled. Sometimes many fantast

309
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:06,480
That creates agitation.

310
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,200
When desire is not fulfilled,

311
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:19,120
it creates agitation. When is fulfilled, it creates agitation.

312
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:24,800
Understand?

313
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,000
When your mind is agitated, your intellect, your intellect is like

314
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:42,000
the flashlight. But if your sleeve is constantly agitated over your flashlight,

315
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,560
you can't handle it. Can't really use it.

316
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:55,200
That's called moa.

317
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:07,840
You are unable to see things in a healthy manner.

318
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:14,320
Let's see how situation. Let me repeat that.

319
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:30,800
You go on repeating the object in your mind. You become attached.

320
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,120
Attachment brings desire.

321
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:40,720
From anger.

322
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,520
Because of anger you get this delusion.

323
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:54,400
When you have your memory of what is right,

324
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:03,760
what is wrong has gone away. You don't even know what you are really looking for.

325
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:13,520
When that state has reached then in spite of the flashlight in your hand flashlight as

326
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:22,800
if doesn't work. So you're not guided by it. You're guided by the illusions of your mind.

327
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:33,120
In other words, you are unable to develop vive buddhi, a healthy intellect that sees

328
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:42,160
the difference between right and wrong, recognizes the right course. Once that has happened, you are

329
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:51,920
being led to destruction figuratively. That means all progress depends upon a healthy intellect.

330
00:51:52,560 --> 00:52:01,520
But all this sequence has led the intellect to become as if dead. Allow the intellect

331
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:10,240
to be dead. Then you are going to be destroyed. Figurative language.

332
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:20,480
Live in such a way that this series of mistakes don't take place. And with this
